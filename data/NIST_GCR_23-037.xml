    <abstract>The three categories of critical facilities addressed in this document are hospitals, K-12 educational facilities, and data centers. This review focuses on both requirements for new building design as well as for existing building renovations or additions for the flood, wind, and seismic hazards. An overall review of current design practices for these three categories of critical facilities within our communities is discussed, along with some of the best practices currently being utilized to provide more resilience within these facilities. The target audience of this report includes industry associations, design professionals, building code officials, city planners, and researchers.</abstract>
