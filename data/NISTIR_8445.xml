    <abstract>Risk management is an important topic in any domain. With the growing acceptance and adoption of Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI), both the academic and industrial communities are beginning to take a more serious look at the risks and rewards of using IAI. This paper summarizes insights generated at the 2021 INFORMs panel addressing the risk-based evaluation of AI use from both a performance and business impacts perspective. The summarized insights are gathered and presented in a logical fashion to highlight identified gaps and barriers in the evaluation and adoption of IAI technologies. Additional context and suggestions regarding paths forward are provided by the authors.</abstract>
