    <abstract>The DSQAP was launched, in collaboration with the NIH ODS, in 2007. The program was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements in samples for nutrients, marker compounds, toxic elements, and/or contaminants in dietary supplement ingredients and finished products. Exercise 1 was designed with 7 studies, offering the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in house techniques on a variety measurements. Studies included determinations of select toxic and nutritional elements, vitamins, contaminants, and proximates in kelp, polyphenol content in kelp and green tea, water-soluble vitamins in meal replacement drink formulations, and botanical marker compounds in dietary supplement ingredient materials and finished products. This report summarizes the results, describes observations, and provides technical recommendations for measurement improvements.</abstract>
