    <abstract>The Workshop on Measurement of Electrical Quantities in Pulse Power Systems addressed measurements in pulse systems having the characteristics of pulse duration less than a millisecond, system voltages greater than 10 kilovolts, and system currents greater than 10 kiloamperes. The presented papers were divided into four categories: voltage measurements; current measurements; power and energy measurements, and data acquisition. Included are discussions of applications of conventional measurement techniques and state-of-the-art systems.</abstract>
