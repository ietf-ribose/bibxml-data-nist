    <abstract>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to organizations in securing their legacy Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN) that cannot use IEEE 802.11i. The document provides an overview of legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards, components, and architectural models. It discusses the basics of WLAN security and examines the security capabilities provided by legacy IEEE 802.11 standards. The document also discusses threats and vulnerabilities involving legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs, explains common countermeasures, and makes recommendations for their use.</abstract>
