    <abstract>A new constant force experiment has been used to study the minimum force required to maintain a seal with five of the better elastomeric O-ring compounds. The most significant result is development of an indium-elastomer sandwich arrangement which takes advantage of the favorable properties of both materials and greatly reduces the force required to maintain a seal at cryogenic temperature. Force decay data are given for three more groups of elastomeric O-rings and some general ideas on seal design are presented.</abstract>
