    <abstract>This publication provides a catalog of internet of things (IoT) device cybersecurity capabilities (i.e., features and functions needed from a device to support security controls) and non-technical supporting capabilities (i.e., actions and support needed from device manufacturers and other supporting entities to support security controls) that can help organizations as they use Special Publication (SP) 800-213 to determine and establish device cybersecurity requirements. This catalog cross references the capabilities in the catalog to the cybersecurity controls in NIST SP 800-53. Organizations should refer to SP 800-213 as that publication provides necessary context to effectively use this catalog and related material.</abstract>
