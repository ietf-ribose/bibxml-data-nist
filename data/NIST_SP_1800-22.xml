    <abstract>Many organizations provide employees the flexibility to use their personal mobile devices to perform work-related activities. An ineffectively secured personal mobile device could expose an organization or employee to data loss or a privacy compromise. Ensuring that an organizationâ€™s data is protected when it is accessed from personal devices poses unique challenges and threats. Allowing employees to use their personal mobile devices for work-related activities is commonly known as a bring your own device (BYOD) deployment. A BYOD deployment offers a convenient way to remotely access organizational resources, while avoiding the alternative of carrying both a work phone and personal phone. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates how organizations can use standards-based, commercially available products to help meet their BYOD security and privacy needs.</abstract>
