    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is sponsoring the Community Resilience Assessment Methodology (CRAM) project. The CRAM project team is working in parallel with several other NIST initiatives, including: the Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (https://www.nist.gov/el/resilience/community-resilience- planning-guides), the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning (https://resilience.colostate.edu/), and the Community Resilience Panel for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (https://www.crpanel.org/). The objective of the CRAM project is to develop a foundation for assessing resilience at the community scale. For the purposes of this project, community resilience is defined as the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions (PPD-21 2013), and a community is defined as a place designated by geographical boundaries that functions under the jurisdiction of a governance structure, such as a town, city, or county (NIST 2015). This report continues the develop the concept of community dimensions and services and expands the concept to the dimensions of sustenance, housing and shelter, relationships, and education.</abstract>
