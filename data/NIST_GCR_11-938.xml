    <abstract>This document analyzes the suitability of Quality Reporting Data Architecture (QRDA) to meet its purpose and to support the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Meaningful Use. It is part of the Healthcare Information Technology (HIT) Standards Analysis Project carried out by Lantana Consulting Group for The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We applied the methodology described in the "Healthcare Information Technology Standards: General Suitability Analysis" also prepared for NIST. We also focused on whether QRDA meets the current and projected data requirements of Meaningful Use.</abstract>
