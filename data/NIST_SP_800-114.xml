    <abstract>This publication helps teleworkers secure the external devices they use for telework, such as personally owned and privately owned desktop and laptop computers and consumer devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants [PDA]). The document focuses specifically on security for telework involving remote access to their organization's nonpublic computing resources. It provides practical, real-world recommendations for securing telework computers operating systems (OS) and applications, as well as home networks that the computers use. It presents basic recommendations for securing consumer devices used for telework. The document also presents advice on protecting the information stored on telework computers and removable media. In addition, it provides tips on considering the security of a device owned by a third party before deciding whether it should be used for telework.</abstract>
