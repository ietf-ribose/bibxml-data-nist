    <abstract>To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution, energy companies need to control physical and logical access to their resources, including buildings, equipment, information technology (IT), and operational technology (OT). They must authenticate authorized individuals to the devices and facilities to which they are giving access rights with a high degree of certainty. In addition, they need to enforce access control policies (e.g., allow, deny, inquire further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of their resources. This project resulted from direct dialog among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity subsector, mainly from electric power companies and those who provide equipment and/or services to them. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a converged, standards-based technical approach that unifies identity and access management (IdAM) functions across OT networks, physical access control systems (PACS), and IT systems. These networks often operate independently, which can result in identity and access information disparity, increased costs, inefficiencies, and loss of capacity and service delivery capability. This guide describes our collaborative efforts with technology providers and electric utility stakeholders to address the security challenges energy providers face in the core function of IdAM. It offers a technical approach to meeting the challenge and also incorporates a business value mind-set by identifying the strategic considerations involved in implementing new technologies. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular, open, end-to-end example solution that can be tailored and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes and sophistication. It shows energy providers how we met the challenge using open source and commercially available tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity standards.</abstract>
