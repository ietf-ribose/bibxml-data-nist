    <abstract>ASHRAE Guideline 36 High Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems was developed to provide a reference set of high-performance control sequences for air-side heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment, including multiple-zone variable-air-volume (VAV) air handlers and associated terminal equipment. The intent is that high-performance buildings will perform better if well-known sequences of operation are specified and controls contractors refine their products to correctly implement them. In this work functional performance tests for the Guideline 36 sequences were developed and implemented using the HVAC-Cx commissioning tool. The HVAC-Cx Functional Performance Test Module was used to commission an implementation of Guideline 36 sequences in the NIST Virtual Cybernetic Building Testbed. The functional performance tests are described and the effectiveness of using the HVAC-Cx tool for detecting faults and implementation errors is evaluated.</abstract>
