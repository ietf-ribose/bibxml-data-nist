    <abstract>This is the proceedings of a Roundtable Discussion of Radon in Buildings held June 15, 1979 at the National Bureau of Standards in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The meeting brought together a number of participants with diverse interdisciplinary interest in radiation protection, radiation measurement and building technology, provided a forum to exchange information, and drew attention to some of the problems and research needs associated with radiation exposure due to radon in buildings. Emphasis was placed on (1) the characterization of the sources and pathways of radon in buildings; (2) the biological and health effects; (3) measurement considerations; and (4) strategies and control technologies to minimize indoor radiation exposure.</abstract>
