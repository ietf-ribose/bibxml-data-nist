    <abstract>In February 2020, Office of Data and Informatics Group Lead Gretchen Greene asked Metadata Librarian Andrea Medina-Smith to perform a CoreTrustSeal (CTS) self-audit of the Public Data Repository (PDR) in preparation for submitting an application for the CoreTrustSeal Certification. This certification is a lightweight, but thorough assessment of a given data repository's policies, documentation, and technical infrastructure supporting 16 required elements of assessment. The requirements are broadly split into the following themes: background information, organizational infrastructure, digital object management, and technology. These elements together form a picture of the trustworthiness of the data repository. The following self-audit report is a snapshot of where the PDR stands as of August 2020.</abstract>
