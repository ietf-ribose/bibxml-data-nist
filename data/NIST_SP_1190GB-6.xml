    <abstract>This Guide Brief focuses on assisting communities with Step 2, Understand the Situation, with respect to communication systems. When characterizing communication systems in a community, communities need to gain an understanding of both service provider systems and their own systems. In some situations, communities may need to leverage communication service provider systems and their capabilities. In other cases, communities may have the capability to provide their own recovery resources. The primary intended audience for this Guide Brief is the portion of the collaborative planning team focused on understanding and improving recovery of communication systems.</abstract>
