    <abstract>The goal of this second phase of work is to improve technical aspects of nonstructural system design in the areas that will have the largest impact for public safety and economic welfare. This report summarizes the body of knowledge gathered and developed to advance the understanding of the response of nonstructural components to earthquakes. The report also makes recommendations for changes to building codes and practice.</abstract>
