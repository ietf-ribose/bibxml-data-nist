    <abstract>The NIST policy on metrological traceability (NIST P 5800.00, which became effective on May 31st, 2019) is transcribed and supplemented with a review of relevant terminology and with a list of frequently asked questions and answers. This list updates and amplifies a similar list originally prepared by a team organized and led by Richard Kayser, which was published in the World Wide Web, and comprises questions about: metrological traceability in general; establishing metrological traceability; NIST and NIST's role in metrological traceability; NIST products and services; and international aspects of traceability.</abstract>
