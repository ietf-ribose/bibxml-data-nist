    <abstract>This document is part of a series intended to provide guidance to the Federal Government for using cryptography and NISTs cryptographic standards to protect sensitive, but unclassified digitized information during transmission and while in storage. Special Publication (SP) 800- 175A provides guidance on the determination of requirements for using cryptography. It includes a summary of laws and regulations concerning the protection of the Federal Governments sensitive information, guidance regarding the conduct of risk assessments to determine what needs to be protected and how best to protect that information, and a discussion of the relevant security-related documents (e.g., various policy and practice documents).</abstract>
