    <abstract>This report presents insights into the impact of distributed energy resources (DER) price-responsive behavior on voltage for a distribution grid with significant customer-owned solar photovoltaics (PV) and batteries in addition to price-responsive heat pumps and water heaters. Price responsive loads result in more variable power flows and voltages. While peak load is reduced, significant amount of flexibility (load response) in this distribution grid increases the total power flow and voltage variation across the day while reducing hosting capacity. That is, while the loads on the grid provide significant flexibility to the bulk grid, this flexibility comes at the expense of voltage variability and significant power flow changes and even reverse power flows at the substation.</abstract>
