    <abstract>Background: Wireless technology has great appeals to many manufacturers, in this case industrial automation systems, which include process control, discrete manufacturing, safety systems, and building automation. Applying wireless sensing and control technologies in new or existing systems for monitoring and controlling equipment and processes eliminates costly cabling and enables configuration flexibility. In addition, using wireless technologies can improve plant-floor operating conditions, performance, and efficiency. But before applying these technologies, companies need to determine what wireless technology will be suitable and reliably operate to communicate measurement and control data in challenging industrial environments with many potential physical obstructions and sources of interference. Purpose: To explore latest and future wireless technologies for establishing best practice guidelines to help manufacturers and users make confident decisions in selecting and applying appropriate wireless technologies for their plants or factories based on their operating requirements and environments.</abstract>
