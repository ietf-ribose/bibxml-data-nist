    <abstract>RP 10 allows federal agencies to identify conditions in an existing building that may pose unacceptable seismic risks to the agency in case of undesirable performance of the building during an earthquake. Agency exposure to unacceptable risks is generally determined through a seismic evaluation and risk assessment of the building. RP 10 provides triggers for a seismic evaluation for project circumstances such as major alterations, additions, or repairs, as well as change of use or leasing requirements. Evaluation necessitated by triggers is referred to as the mandatory process. RP 10 additionally addresses risk awareness by having agencies proactively implement evaluations based on inventory screening, which is independent of passive trigger requirements identified in the mandatory process. This process is referred to as the screening process. RP 10 provides circumstances to assist an agency in developing a screening process. RP 10 also identifies buildings exempt from seismic evaluation. RP 10 provides the minimum seismic performance objective for evaluation of existing buildings owned or leased by the Federal Government. The basic performance objective is based on risk to occupant safety in a large, rare earthquake by total or partial collapse of the building. Higher performance objectives are provided that can be used to assess the risks of loss of operative systems, extended re-occupancy and recovery time, or economic losses. RP 10 references model building codes published by the International Code Council as well as national consensus standards published by the American Society of Civil Engineers to provide the basis for defining seismic performance objectives, evaluation procedures, and, where necessary, retrofit criteria.</abstract>
