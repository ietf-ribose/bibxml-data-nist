    <abstract>Type FNO-50-12E resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation, were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The results of the evaluation tests indicate that the gage factor at 75¿̐¿ F is lower than the value given by the manufacturer; that the gage factor decreases in a regular, repeatable manner with increasing temperature; that the gages are able to sustain strains of 0.004 or more without failure at 75¿̐¿ and 600¿̐¿ F; that the drift is low at temperatures as high as 800¿̐¿ F; that the temperature sensitivity can be made low and repeatable by the proper choice of circuit constants if the temperature does not exceed 850¿̐¿ F; that the gage response is repeatable when subjected to transient heating conditions; and that the gage response is not greatly affected by heating rate.</abstract>
