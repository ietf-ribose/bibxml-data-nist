    <abstract>This report examines costs of machinery maintenance along with losses due to inadequate maintenance strategies in discrete manufacturing (NAICS 321-339, excluding NAICS 324 and 325) using data collected from U.S. manufacturers. The report further examined the perceived and observed benefits of investing in and advancing maintenance strategies. Estimates for costs and losses are annual values for 2016. Machinery maintenance expenditures for NAICS 321- 339 (excluding 324 and 325) were estimated to be $5 7.3 billion for 2016. Losses due to preventable maintenance issues amounted to $1 19.1 billion. The top 25 % of those establishments relying on reactive maintenance was associated with 3.3 times more downtime than those in the bottom 25 %. They were also associated with 16.0 times more defects, 2.8 more lost sales due to defects from maintenance, 2.4 times more lost sales due to delays from maintenance, and 4.9 times more inventory increases due to maintenance issues.</abstract>
