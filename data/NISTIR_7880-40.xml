    <abstract>Since 1984, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has coordinated what is now known as the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. The MMQAP has provided participants with measurement comparability assessment through use of interlaboratory studies, Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) and control materials, methods development and validation, workshops, and tutorials. This report reproduces the printed materials provided to participants in the 1997 Fat-Soluble Vitamin and Carotenoid Analysis Tutorials, the most recent in a series of hands-on training programs for laboratorians involved in fat-soluble vitamin-related analytes. Some of the tutorial material has been updated.</abstract>
