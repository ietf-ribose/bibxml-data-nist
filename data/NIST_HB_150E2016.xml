    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150, 2015 edition, sets forth the procedures and general requirements under which the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) operates as an unbiased third party to accredit testing and calibration laboratories. The 2015 edition of NIST Handbook 150 supersedes and replaces the 2006 edition. In addition to a number of editorial revisions, the 2015 edition incorporates the following main changes with respect to the previous edition: (1) incorporation of previously issued NVLAP Policy Guides and updated definitions and references; (2) addition of Annex E, which contains the requirements for accredited laboratories wishing to use the Accredited Laboratory Combined ILAC MRA Mark; and (3) removal of the managerial and technical requirements of ISO/IEC 17025, which were previously contained in NIST Handbook 150 clauses 4 and 5, respectively. Annexes A through E form a normative part of this handbook, meaning they contain provisions that laboratories must meet in order to conform to the requirements for accreditation. Testing and calibration laboratories use NIST Handbook 150 in developing the management and technical systems that govern their operations. Laboratory customers, regulatory authorities, and accreditation bodies may also use it as a basis upon which to judge the competence of laboratories.</abstract>
