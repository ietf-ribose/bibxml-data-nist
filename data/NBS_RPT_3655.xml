    <abstract>Computations, based on a proposed method of computing the influence coefficients of a delta wing, were made to determine the influence coefficients of a swept-back model wing for which experimental results were available. Comparison of computed results with experimental data showed poor agreement. The lack of agreement is in part attributed to insufficient knowledge regarding the shear stiffness of ribs and bulkheads.</abstract>
