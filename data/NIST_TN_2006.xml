    <abstract>An eight-laboratory study provided the data to evaluate variability in tensile mechanical properties of cobalt-chrome alloy (UNS R31538) made by metals-based additive manufacturing. In the study, six laboratories employed laser powder-bed-fusion additive manufacturing, and two additional laboratories employed electron-beam powder-bed fusion. For the fve laboratories that employed nominally identical laser powder-bed fusion systems, the between-laboratory variability in yield strength and tensile strength was several times larger than the within-laboratory variability. Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy revealed that each laboratory produced slightly different microstructures. Thermodynamic modeling of the solidifcation and subsequent post-build heat treating demonstrated that the fnal microstructure is sensitive to the exact heat-treating conditions.</abstract>
