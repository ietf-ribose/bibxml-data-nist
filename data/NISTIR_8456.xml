    <abstract>The pixel is often used as a unit of measurement in information technology. Unfortunately, there is not a simple, consistently-applicable answer to what it is a measure of. This report analyzes the pixel unit through the lens of metrology and shows how one entity, the pixel, actually gives rise to a group of different units.</abstract>
