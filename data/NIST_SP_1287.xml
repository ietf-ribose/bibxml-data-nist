    <abstract>This report summarizes the findings of the NIST Scientific Integrity Program assessment of the program for the period between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2022. It provides an assessment of the current state of the program in advance of planned updates in 2022. The evaluation was initiated in response to a recommendation from a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, Scientific Integrity Policies: Additional Actions Could Strengthen Integrity of Federal Research, April 2019. In addition, the report serves as a baseline evaluation before implementation of substantial updates to the program related to the Presidential Memorandum on Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based Policy Making, January 27, 2021.</abstract>
