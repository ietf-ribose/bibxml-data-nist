    <abstract>Existing and proposed U.S. flammability standards for soft furnishings such as mattresses and upholstered furniture specify a standard cigarette as the ignition source in smoldering resistance performance tests. With the introduction of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes into the marketplace, the specific conventional cigarette that has been widely used in testing for ignition resistance is no longer in production. A standard reference cigarette, SRM 1196, has been developed as a short-term replacement. However, to support furnishings manufacturers and testing organizations in product design and evaluation, and to assist regulators in the compliance evaluation process, a feasible and preferably non-agricultural ignition source with long-term availability is desirable. A key first step in establishing such a standard ignition source is examination of prior characterizations of smoldering ignition sources and the cigarette ignition process. This report documents a literature survey on these topics.</abstract>
