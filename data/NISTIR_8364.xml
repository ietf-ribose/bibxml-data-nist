    <abstract>In the past decade, numerous public and private sector documents have highlighted the need for materials data to facilitate advanced technologies in myriad industrial and economic sectors. These documents have been analyzed to identify prevalent gaps in the establishment of an interconnected materials data infrastructure akin to that envisioned in the federal agency-wide Materials Genome Initiative. This internal report uses a uniform schematic format to portray these gaps, illustrate progress in addressing the gaps, and propose an MML roadmap of action items to further address the gaps.</abstract>
