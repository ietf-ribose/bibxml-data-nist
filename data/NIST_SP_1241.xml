    <abstract>A workshop of the permanent working group, sponsored by the International Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS), entitled Large Outdoor Fires and the Built Environment(LOF) was held from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on Sunday June 30, 2019. The workshop was held as a part of the 2019 Interflam Conference in Egham, United Kingdom. The working group is co-led by Sara McAllister of the U.S. Forest Service, Sayaka Suzuki of National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster, and Samuel L. Manzello of NIST's Engineering Laboratory. The IAFSS permanent working group consists of three subgroups, with subleaders appointed by Manzello, McAllister, and Suzuki, and these are prioritized into the following topics: Ignition Resistant Communities (IRC, led by Elsa Pastor, UPC), Emergency Management and Evacuation (EME, led by Enrico Ronchi, Lund University), and Large Outdoor Firefighting (LOFF, led by Raphaele Blanchi, CSIRO, unable to travel to UK). The IRC subgroup is focused on developing the scientific basis for new standard testing methodologies indicative of large outdoor fire exposures, including the development of necessary testing methodologies to characterize wildland fuel treatments adjacent to communities. The EME subgroup is focused on developing the scientific basis for effective emergency management strategies for communities exposed to large outdoor fires. The LOFF subgroup is providing a review of various tactics that are used, as well as the various personal protective equipment (PPE), and suggest pathways for research community engagement, including environmental issues in suppressing these fires. At the workshop, detailed progress was presented regarding activities of all the subgroups. An extended session was held for open discussion so that participants could provide feedback on current progress and offer suggestions for the upcoming LOF workshop being organized as part of IAFSS 2020.</abstract>
