    <abstract>This report describes how different smart manufacturing standards and technologies, such as MTConnect, were integrated in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) Test Bed to support the collection, curation, and re-use of manufacturing data. The intended audience of this report includes researchers, technical-assessment personnel, and end-users who would like to collect data from manufacturing equipment on the shop floor to improve the performance of production systems. Included in this document is basic guidance to replicate the NIST SMS Test Bed in research and production environments, including the protocols, information systems, and automation that were required.</abstract>
