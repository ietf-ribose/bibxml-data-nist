    <abstract>The ninth installment of the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Summit was hosted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on April 2-5, 2018. The MBE Summit 2018 witnessed another year-over-year registration growth. This speaks to the growing interest of MBE within the community and the importance of the Summit output. The MBE Summit 2018 Program Committee undertook a significant effort to ensure a high-quality summit and signal to the community that the MBE Summit is the best place for gathering and sharing information dedicated to the digital transformation across the product lifecycle. The MBE Summit 2018 focused on empowering the industrial shift to MBE with recommended practices and how-to guidance. The MBE Summit 2018 theme was Empowering the Digital Transformation with an Integrated Lifecycle, with technical tracks spanning across Systems Engineering and Lifecycle Management, Design Recommended Practice and Model-Based Definition, Model-Based Manufacturing, and Model-Based Quality and Inspection. The MBE Summit had 70 submissions for presentation, of which the Program Committee accepted eight papers, 33 presentations, five posters, and two panels. This report is the proceedings of the MBE Summit 2018.</abstract>
