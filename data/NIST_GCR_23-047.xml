    <abstract>In September 2022, the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers commenced a project under National Institute of Standards and Technology Contract No. 133ND22PNB730391 to develop workshops on Advancement in Computational Wind Engineering and Advancement in Performance-Based Wind Design. This report documents the results of the workshop on Advancement in Computational Wind Engineering. The workshop and subsequent roadmap for the standardization and application of computational wind engineering is to be developed by wind engineering practitioners and researchers for buildings.</abstract>
