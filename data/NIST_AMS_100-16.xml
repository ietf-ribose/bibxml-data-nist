    <abstract>Additive manufacturing (AM) is a revolutionary manufacturing technique, which is expected to reshape the future manufacturing industries. While various materials are used in AM, metal AM is expected to provide a high impact to the industries by producing high-strength structural components. Defects occurring in AM, however, prevent the technique from a wide spread adoption to the mainstream industry. This paper provides a review of commonly-occurring defects in metal AM-produced components. It describes various types and causes of defects, provides implications on the needs of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to inspect such defects.</abstract>
