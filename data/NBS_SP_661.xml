    <abstract>ASTM and NBS co-sponsored a Basestock Consistency Study (BCS) to assess the quality consistency of lubricating base oils. This study, which is the first of its kind, will impact on developing basestock characterization methodology and on efficient utilization of energy resources as well as their conservation through recycling. The purpose of this publication is to present the ASTM/NBS BCS data for data analysis. Monthly production samples from six re-refiners and four refiners were analyzed by 14 laboratories for a 13 month period. The results of over 55 tests are divided according to six major categories: rheology, physical properties, chemical properties, hydrocarbon type analysis, general performance tests, and oxidation and wear bench tests. The data are presented in tabular and grphical form, which is quite amenable to further data analysis.</abstract>
