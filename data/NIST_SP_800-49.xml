    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division, has developed this S/MIME (Secure / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) client profile as guidance in the development and procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) S/MIME-compliant products. This profile document identifies requirements for a secure and interoperable S/MIME V3 client implementation. NIST is developing tests and testing tools to determine the level of conformance of an S/MIME V3 client implementation with this profile.</abstract>
