    <abstract>This economic analysis brief summarizes the efforts and results of the data collection and analysis of NIST's calibration customer information. Summary statistics for calibration customers are provided for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Included in the analysis are demographically descriptive variables such as the age, location, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, number of employees and geographic distribution of NIST calibration customers. Overall, these features provide an understanding of the demographic characteristics of entities that purchase calibration services from NIST.</abstract>
