    <abstract>This report summarizes measurement challenges identified in four main pillars of global food safety (microbiological contaminants, chemical contaminants, allergens, and authenticity and adulteration) as described by the experts assembled at the workshop and explores potential future actions needed to improve food safety measurement science. This paper is accompanied by a second, complementary report on the international capabilities across national metrology institutes (NMIs) and other reference material producers present at the workshop and prospective actions to ensure global food safety.</abstract>
