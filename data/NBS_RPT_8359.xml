    <abstract>Type FNW-FB-9-50-12 resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation, were evaluated. The results of these tests indicate that the gage factor for compressive loading is somewhat higher than for tensile loading; that the gage factor decreases with increasing temperature by about one-half percent per 100¿̐¿ F; that large errors can be expected when strains greater than 0.002 are measured; that the gages are well compensated for resistance instability; that the temperature sensitivity is low and repeatable from gage to gage, but the gage response is strongly affected by heating rate; and that the leakage resistance is influenced by temperature and the thermal history of the gage.</abstract>
