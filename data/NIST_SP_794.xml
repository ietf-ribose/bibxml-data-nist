    <abstract>The Special Publication contains infrared and mass spectra for a wide range of chlorofluoro-bromo ethanes and ethylenes that are relevant to research on alternative refrigerants. Alternative refrigerants are working fluids that are thought not to contribute significantly to atmospheric ozone depletion. In addition to the spectroscopic data, some physical property and safety information is included for each fluid as well. Not all of the compounds covered in the publication can be used as refrigerants. Indeed, some of them are in fact solids under ambient conditions, and others are fully halogenated, thus making them unfavorable from an ozone depletion standpoint. The study of all of these materials is important, however, since many will be found as impurities or reaction/decomposition products of refrigerant fluids. The publication provides a signal source for some particularly useful analytical information needed in the identification of these compounds.</abstract>
