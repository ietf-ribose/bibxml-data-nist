    <abstract>It can be assumed that smoke alarms reduce reported fires and casualties by reducing on average the amount of time it takes to detect a fire. This paper sets out to determine by how much that detection time is reduced. It does so by comparing the effect of smoke-alarm presents (and time of day) to the effect of fire-department travel time using data from the National Fire Incident Reporting System. On average, smoke alarms reduce reporting time by 19.2 ( 0.016) minutes. This is comparable to the average time delay from having a fire at night. If smoke alarms are present, having a fire at night (between the hours of 11 and 6) adds 18.1 ( 0.013) minutes, and without an alarm, having a fire at night adds on average 20.5 ( 0.024). Smoke alarms are more effective at night, saving 2.4 ( 0.016) minutes more at night than during the day.</abstract>
