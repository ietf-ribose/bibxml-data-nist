    <abstract>The Dimensional Metrology Group (DMG) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a unique 60 m long length facility that provides traceable reference lengths for the evaluation of measuring tapes, optical fibers, electronic distance meters, laser trackers and terrestrial laser scanners. In this report, we compare three methods to evaluate the ranging error of laser trackers in this facility. These include the back-to-back, the common path single pass, and the common path double pass method. We describe the different methods and compare them in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.</abstract>
