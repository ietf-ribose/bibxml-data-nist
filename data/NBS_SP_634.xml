    <abstract>In the past, for the most part, precision electromagnetic measurements were concerned with the measurement of parameters for sinusoidal (or steady state) excitation and response, e.g., magnitude, phase, and power. One reason for the popularity of frequency domain measurement was that in this domain only one complete data point need be recorded to constitute a useful measurement. Recording a thousand data points as required for precision time domain waveform measurements simply was not feasible. Today such frequency domain measurements are still important but now share their importance with transient pulse time domain measurements. With the emergence of integrated circuit components for (1) sampling or analog to digital conversion, (2) storage, and (3) control, real time digital waveform recording is now practical and widespread in usage. Furthermore, by coupling waveform recording components to minicomputers and microprocessors integrated circuitry it is now possible to record single events using compact systems (instruments) which acquire, record, process, and analyze transient signals. In fact, the incorporation of digital computation integrated circuitry appears to be a major driving force in expanding the role of waveform measurements in the academic, industrial and scientific communities.</abstract>
