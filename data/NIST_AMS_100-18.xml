    <abstract>The manufacturing atmosphere is continually changing with new technologies and standards being swiftly developed. Firms create competitive advantages using their knowledge, skills, supply chains, and processes to create superior products at lower prices. In such a competitive environment, efficient machinery maintenance methods can mean the difference between a thriving profitable firm and one that loses money and sales. Currently, at the national level there is limited understanding of the costs and losses associated with machinery maintenance or the different machinery maintenance techniques. This report examines the literature and data available for estimating the costs and losses relevant to different manufacturing maintenance techniques. It extends further to identify the data needed for making such estimates and the feasibility of collecting the relevant data. This report focuses on, but is not limited to, four categories of manufacturing: machinery, computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, and transportation equipment manufacturers.</abstract>
