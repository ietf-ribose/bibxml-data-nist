    <abstract>This is a report for Inter-agency agreement 693KA9-18-N-00023 "Maximum Luminous Intensity for LED Signaling in an Airport Environment" by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The LED-based lighted X signs recently introduced at many airports are perceived too bright by pilots, causing glare and making it difficult to recognize the X character. The objective of the study is to determine the acceptable level of maximum luminous intensity of LED-lighted X signs that maintains clear visibility of the lighted X sign. A theoretical study with literature review was first made (Part 1). Then vision experiments were conducted using pilots as subjects (Part 2). The methods and results of these studies are reported.</abstract>
