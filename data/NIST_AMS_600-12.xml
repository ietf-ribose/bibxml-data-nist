    <abstract>This document provides an overview of the stakeholder responses, consensus and an overarching summary of some of the thematic areas that emerged from the Request for Information (RFI). NIST's approach to summarizing the comments received in the RFI was to capture the range and breadth of public input, including common themes and points of divergence. NIST appreciates the richness of the input received from and recognizes that detailed specific comments may not be included in this summary. Readers who would like to see the comments in their entirety can find those at regulations.gov. The RFI analysis and high-level summary was performed by the NIST team by categorizing responses by the five RFI topic areas, individual questions and corresponding responses when applicable, and respondent and organization type. Where applicable, the NIST team also appropriately mapped comments from the text of the general responses to specific RFI questions. Where applicable, specific suggestions from the responses were reproduced as part of the high-level summary.</abstract>
