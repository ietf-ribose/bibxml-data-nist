    <abstract>This document provides best practice guidelines for integrating the PIV Card with the physical access control systems (PACS) that authenticate the cardholders in Federal facilities. Specifically, this document recommends a risk-based approach for selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms to manage physical access to Federal government facilities and assets. This document also proposes a PIV implementation maturity model to measure the progress of facility and agency implementations.</abstract>
