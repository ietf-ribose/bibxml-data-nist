    <abstract>The public safety community is in the process of transitioning from the use of land mobile radios to a technology ecosystem including a variety of broadband data sharing platforms. Successful deployment and adoption of new communication technology relies on efficient and effective user interfaces based on a clear understanding of first responder needs, requirements and contexts of use. The project employs a two-phased data collection approach for an in-depth look at the population of first responders, along with their work environment, their tasks, and their communication needs. This report documents the data collection of Phase 1 and the first iteration of data analysis. Phase 1, the qualitative component, focuses on interviews with approximately 240 first responders (law enforcement, fire fighters, emergency medical services, communications/dispatch) across the country. Results include: approximately 90 user needs and requirements expressed by first responders; five categories of technology opportunities; six principles for technology development; and the role of trust in usage of communication technology.</abstract>
