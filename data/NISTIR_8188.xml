    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed to measure the performance impact induced by cybersecurity technologies on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The testbed allows researchers to emulate real-world industrial manufacturing processes and their control systems without the need to replicate an entire production or factory environment. The focus of this report is the Process Control System of the Testbed, which emulate an industrial continuous manufacturing system. A continuous manufacturing is a process to manufacture, produce, or process materials without interruption, the materials being processed are continuously in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment. Continuous manufacturing usually implies a 24x7 operation with infrequent maintenance shutdowns. Continuous manufacturing is contrasted with batch manufacturing . Examples of continuous manufacturing include, chemical production, oil refining, natural gas processing, and waste water treatment process.</abstract>
