    <abstract>From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinated the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat- soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Spring and Fall 1987 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin IX Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin XI Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum. The first participant results for Round Robin IX were received April 22, 1987; the last results were received June 23, 1987. The first participant results for Round Robin XI were received July 8, 1987; the last results were received September 4, 1987. The analytes in Round Robin X were selenium and zinc and are not discussed in this report.</abstract>
