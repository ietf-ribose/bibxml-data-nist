    <abstract>The Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing is currently constructing an open, standards-based flexible manufacturing cell. The manufacturing cell must take in a product definition, machine the defined part, inspect it, rework as necessary, and provide a final dimensional report. In support of this effort, we define a flexible architecture based entirely on open standards. In this paper we look at standards which support a modelbased engineering approach to conveying product definitions to the manufacturing cell. The STEP AP242, QIF, and JT standards are compared and the various considerations for their use discussed. Finally we define a selected standard to use and the software that will be used in order to implement the chosen standard mix.</abstract>
