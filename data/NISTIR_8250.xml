    <abstract>This publication contains standard operating procedures for calibrations that were not previously published in other NIST Office of Weights and Measures publications and are included here in support of weights and measures laboratory program requirements to ensure suitable metrological traceability, and uncertainty in calibrations. The current and proposed procedures cover a variety of measurement parameters including: time and frequency, electricity, mass, force, volume, dimensional, thermodynamic, pressure, liquid and solid density, and magnetism in mass standards.</abstract>
