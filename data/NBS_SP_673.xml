    <abstract>This paper presents a model for measuring the benefits of improved accuracy in test equipment. The model permits calculation of the probability of accepting a unit under test (UUT) that is out of specifications (i.e., Consumer's Loss) and the probability of rejecting a UUT that is within specifications (i.e., Producer's Loss) for alternative levels of test equipment accuracy. Accuracy is defined in terms of both the systematic and the random measurement error of the equipment. Other parameters that are taken into account by the model are the mean and variance of the UUT attribute of interest, the performance specifications of the UUT, and the test specifications which define acceptance and rejection in terms of test measurement results. A discussion of the economic consequences of Consumer's Loss and Producer's Loss is included. The model may be used to optimize both procurement policy for new test equipment as well as maintenance and calibration policy for existing test equipment.</abstract>
