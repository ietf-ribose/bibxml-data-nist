    <abstract>The SARS-CoV-2 virus has put a strain on the supply and distribution of N95 masks, with some hospitals electing to reuse masks after disinfection. Currently, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) mask disinfection systems are being deployed at multiple locations throughout the United States, for example in shipping containers and in small rooms. Such enclosures will be of a different size, have different surface materials and have varying air change rates; all these parameters will impact the VHP dose that the masks receive. This paper describes a spreadsheet tool to estimate the VHP concentration in air of such a room. The tool employs a single-zone mass balance analysis that accounts for room size, VHP losses to surfaces and air change rate. This tool is intended to support VHP disinfection efforts by providing estimates of VHP concentrations in the room being employed, but it does not describe or provide guidance on VHP disinfection applications.</abstract>
