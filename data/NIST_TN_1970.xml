    <abstract>The Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been designed to demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to perform optimization of control systems in commercial buildings. This technical note discusses the methodology used to assess the time- dependent variability of measurement devices in the IBAL. The total uncertainty is calculated by combining this variability with the uncertainty of the instrumentation.</abstract>
