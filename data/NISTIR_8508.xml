    <abstract>Advances in robotics research have begun incorporating non-traditional materials, such as elastomers and smart materials (e.g., shape memory alloys, responsive hydrogels, etc.), into the structure of robots giving them new capabilities. This inclusion of soft materials has highlighted a number of metrology challenges related to highly deformable objects or systems. The purpose of this report is to identify the measurement challenges faced by the soft robotics community and propose NIST research to help support these challenges. To accomplish this goal, we surveyed literature including proposed roadmaps for the field, engaged the community through workshops, and engaged industry. This report summarizes challenges for the community and industry and provides a detailed survey of material testing and modeling, including limitations in current practices. We conclude by proposing steps that NIST can take to support metrology within the field which will, in turn, improve industryâ€™s ability to take advantage of this new technology.</abstract>
