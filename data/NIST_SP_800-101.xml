    <abstract>Forensic specialists periodically encounter unusual devices and new technologies outside of traditional computer forensics. Cell phones are an emerging area with such characteristics. The objective of this guide is twofold: to help organizations evolve appropriate policies and procedures for dealing with cell phones, and to prepare forensic specialists to contend with new circumstances involving cell phones, when they arise. This guide provides an in-depth look into cell phones and explains associated technologies and their effect on the procedures followed by forensic specialists. It also discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on cell phones, as well as available forensic software tools that support those activities.</abstract>
