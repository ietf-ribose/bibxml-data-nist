    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150-17 presents the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Cryptographic and Security Testing program. It is intended for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2020 edition of NIST Handbook 150-17 incorporates changes includes a new accreditation scope for Automated Cryptographic Validation Testing, and updates to existing testing programs are included in this handbook, as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-17 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing program.
