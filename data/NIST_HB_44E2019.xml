    <abstract>NIST Handbook 44 was first published in 1949, having been preceded by similar handbooks of various designations and in several forms. This 2019 edition was developed by the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with the assistance of the Office of Weights and Measures for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The handbook includes amendments adopted at the 103rd Annual Meeting of the NCWM in 2018. NIST Handbook 44 is published in its entirety each year following the Annual Meeting of the NCWM.</abstract>
