    <abstract>In September 2016, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. Department of Commerce, awarded funding for five pilot programs for Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate (RAMPS) Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development. The document that follows provides a summary of the five pilot programs and outlines a roadmap for building similar programs based on the best practices found and lessons learned.</abstract>
