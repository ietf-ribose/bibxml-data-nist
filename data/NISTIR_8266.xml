    <abstract>The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP) was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplement community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various regulations, including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). Exercise O of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of contaminants (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), marker compounds in botanicals (curcuminoids) and natural products (chondroitin sulfate), and authenticity of Ginkgo biloba materials in botanical dietary supplement ingredients and finished products.</abstract>
