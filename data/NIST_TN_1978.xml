    <abstract>The behavior of high-strength structural steel bolts at elevated temperatures, especially under shear loading, is very limited in the literature. This report presents the test results, as well as a reduced order modeling approach of high-strength structural bolts subject to double-shear loading at elevated temperatures. First, it presents results from a recently conducted experimental study. The parameters varied between tests included the bolt grade, bolt diameter, and temperature. Bolt grades A325 and A490 were tested. For each bolt grade, three different diameters were tested (19 mm (3/4 in), 22 mm (7/8 in), and 25.4 mm (1 in)) at five different temperatures (20 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C). At least three tests were conducted for each combination of parameters. Degradations in the mechanical and material properties including stiffness, strength, and deformation at fracture, are characterized and presented. The results from these experiments fill a critical knowledge gap currently present in the literature regarding the behavior of high-strength structural bolts under shear loading at elevated temperatures. These data will ultimately provide a thorough understanding of the overall behavior of structural steel systems under realistic fire loading by clarifying the (i) shear behavior of high-strength structural steel bolts at elevated temperatures, and (ii) degradation in the mechanical and material properties of high-strength steel bolts with increasing temperatures. The report then describes the formulation of an empirical component-based model for shear behavior of high-strength bolts developed based on the data from the double-shear testing of highstrength bolts at elevated temperatures. Such component-based models are computationally efficient, facilitating large building-level analyses where high-fidelity modeling of the bolts would be infeasible. The component-based model is shown to accurately account for the temperature dependent degradation of bolt shear strength and stiffness, while also providing the capability to model load reversal and bolt-shear rupture.</abstract>
