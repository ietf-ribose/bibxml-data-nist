    <abstract>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability naming scheme is a dictionary of common names for publicly known information technology (IT) system vulnerabilities. It is an emerging industry standard that has achieved wide acceptance by the security industry and a number of government organizations. Federal departments and agencies should use this standard for computer vulnerability related activities.</abstract>
