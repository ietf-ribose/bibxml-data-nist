    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently developing reference materials (RMs) to support the corn-to-ethanol industry. Two candidate RMs consisting of dried corn biomass intermediates before and after conversion (fermentation) were obtained from commercial ethanol plant facilities. Interlaboratory studies will be used to screen the candidate RMs. This report describes the results of an interlaboratory study for laboratories analyzing starch content for these two candidate RMs and for two starch-based control materials.</abstract>
