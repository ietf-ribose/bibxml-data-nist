    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established a Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements. Participants in the eighth exercise of this program, the Winter 2014 Comparability Study, were asked to use the methodology of their choice to measure concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in pooled human serum control and study materials distributed by NIST. The study materials consisted of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 909c Human Serum and VitDQAP-III (a material designed for the VitDQAP). SRM 968d Fat-Soluble Vitamins, Carotenoids, and Cholesterol in Human Serum Level 1 was provided as a control material. Participants provided their data to NIST, where it was compiled and evaluated for trueness relative to the NIST value and concordance within the participant community. A report of results was provided to all participants of the study, and laboratories were identified by code numbers known only to them. The results from this eighth study are reported along with a summary of the analytical methods used.</abstract>
