    <abstract>Fuel and motor oil quality programs are implemented to provide an official presence in the marketplace to verify that sellers of engine fuels and motor oils have control systems in place to ensure the products they sell conform to the quality specifications in federal and state laws and regulations. Routine, unannounced verification of fuel and motor oil quality enables the programs to identify sellers and their suppliers who have quality control systems in place and to focus enforcement resources on those who do not. This handbook outlines how samples are to be taken, identified, protected and transported to a laboratory for testing. It also provides information on safety and sampling equipment and includes illustrations of the equipment or forms described in the text.</abstract>
