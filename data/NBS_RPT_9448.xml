    <abstract>Experimental evidence is presented which indicates that N atoms produced in a flow system by a microwave discharge through purified N2 have a 'spin-lattice' relaxation time T1 of the order of 25 msec. In a fast flow system, the residence time of the atoms in the EPR magnet can easily be shorter than this. As a result, atoms which are generated outside of the magnet may arrive at the microwave cavity before they have had time to reach their equilibrium magnetization. Addition to the discharged gas of as little as 10 p.p.m. 02 (which did not affect the N atom concentration) decreased the spin relaxation time, and led to increases as great as 7-fold in the N atom EPR signal. Because of the long relaxation time it was necessary to work at the low microwave power level of 0.006 uW to avoid saturation effects. Power saturation was governed primarily by the rate at which unsaturated atoms entered the cavity and not by collision relaxation processes. Interpretation of the effects of 02 addition in terms of a two level spin model allowed us to estimate a value of ~1.5 x 10^-15 cm^2 for the spin exchange cross section for N-02 collisions. Several qualitative observations regarding the nitrogen pink afterglow, electron production, and the effects of N0 addition are also reported.</abstract>
