    <abstract>Public safety officials utilizing the forthcoming public safety broadband networks will have access to devices, such as mobile devices, tablets and wearables. These devices offer new ways for first responders to complete their missions but may also introduce new security vulnerabilities to their work environment. To investigate this impact, the security objectives identified in NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8196, Security Analysis of First Responder Mobile and Wearable Devices, were used to scope the analysis of public safety mobile and wearable devices and the current capabilities that meet those security objectives. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide guidance that enables jurisdictions to select and purchase secure devices and assist industry to design and build secure devices tailored to the needs of first responders.</abstract>
