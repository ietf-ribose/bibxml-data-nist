    <abstract>This report presents the summary of a workshop held at NIST on March 15-16, 2018 on the topic of applied category theory (ACT). The meeting had two main goals: (i) mapping the current ACT landscape and (ii) developing a roadmap for transitioning the field to concrete applications. The report is broken into six sections detailing different aspects relevant to the development of ACT: community development, domain-specific applications, pedagogy, tool support, marketing and funding. Each section contains a discussion of the current state of the field, identifies major goals and challenges in that area, and considers potential strategies and tactics to address them, along with a prospective timeline for future developments.</abstract>
