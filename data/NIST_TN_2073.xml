    <abstract>This guide describes the test setups and processes needed to perform standards-based testing of radiological and nuclear detection systems. This guide is intended to reduce the potential for misinterpretation of performance requirements, test methods, and to improve uniformity of testing methods used at different testing organizations. This guide does not address safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this guide to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.</abstract>
