    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Winter and Summer 2017 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXXI Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum (RR81) and 2) Round Robin LXXXII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum (RR82). To avoid increasing participation fees, the overhead costs for these programs were minimized by shipping the materials for both studies in the same package in February 2017. Participants were requested not to analyze the Summer samples before June 5, 2017 but to provide their measurement results by September 4, 2017. Participants were reminded of the due-date by e-mail in early August 2017.</abstract>
