    <abstract>The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations is important to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully carry out its assigned missions and business operations. This publication provides federal agencies and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures that can be used to carry out assessments of the requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST Special Publication 800-171. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be tailored to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as 1) self-assessments; 2) independent, third-party assessments; or 3) government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can be conducted with varying degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes. The findings and evidence produced during the assessments can be used to facilitate risk-based decisions by organizations related to the CUI enhanced security requirements.</abstract>
