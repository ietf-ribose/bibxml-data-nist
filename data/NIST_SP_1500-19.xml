    <abstract>This specification describes a data format for space-constrained environments, such as the placement of machine readable data on paper. The specification is responsive to a need for interoperability in several key voting system scenarios in which the use of other storage mechanisms are impractical or disallowed. The format s structure is described in prose and code examples.</abstract>
