    <abstract>CYCLE_D simulates vapor compression refrigeration cycles that use single-compound refrigerants or refrigerant blends. The model can simulate a basic subcritical or transcritical refrigeration cycle, both with or without a liquid-line/suction-line heat exchanger. In addition, the model can simulate a subcritical two-stage economizer cycle, a subcritical three- stage economizer cycle, and a subcritical two-stage compression cycle with intercooling. CYCLE_D includes 70 single-compound refrigerants and 97 predefined blends. Single-compound fluids can be combined to form blends of up to five components. Computationally, the program is fully compatible with the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties - REFPROP, Version 9.1.</abstract>
