    <abstract>The objective of the Advanced Electrical Power Sensors Workshop was to provide input into planning processes being undertaken by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Energy (DOE), and the Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC). The workshop provided these entities with the opportunity to hear industry concerns and ideas regarding emerging and future electrical power system sensors, transducers, and transformer technologies. As the grid continues to evolve, and as grid operation and planning support advanced functions, it may be necessary to measure aspects of the grid which have not been measured in the past, or to refine the way current measurements are performed. This workshop explored various means by which grid related activities can be better informed.</abstract>
