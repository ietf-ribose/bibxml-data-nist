    <abstract>Standard-sized ampoules for radioactive solution standards have been employed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for nearly the past 70 years. This report briefly summarizes the origins and history of the five different batches of ampoules that have been used, including details on the procurement and testing of the recent batch of replacement ampoules in 2018.</abstract>
