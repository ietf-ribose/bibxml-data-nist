    <abstract>This test data creation and population document provides an overview of data creation, population and documentation of artifacts created for cloud-based applications specified in Version 1 of Cloud  Remotely Stored Data Extraction (CDX) Using Account Credentials: Specification, Test Assertions, and Test Cases. Due to the frequency of application updates that may occur during testing, it is advised to document the version number of the current application under test to maintain the fairness and integrity of the tool verification process. Comments and feedback are welcome. This document, and future revisions, are available for download at: https:\\www.cftt.nist.gov.</abstract>
