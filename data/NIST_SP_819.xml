    <abstract>High quality liquid-in-glass thermometers require only one complete calibration in their lifetime and it is possible to avoid the usual requirement for complete recalibration of the instrument by the recalibration of a single previously calibrated temperature. The need for recalibration of properly manufactured liquid-in-glass thermometers is due to the gradual relaxation of residual mechanical strains in the glass that have a significant effect on the volume of the bulb. The recalibration of a single point provides a reliable indication of the effect of this change in volume and provides a means for the accurate adjustment of the remainder of the scale. The paper describes a procedure for the single temperature recalibration of liquid-in-glass thermometers that can be performed in the user's laboratory and the subsequent adjustment of the entire scale. The adjustment of the scale that is required by the recent introduction of the new International Temperature Scale (ITS-90) is also described.</abstract>
