    <abstract>This paper describes how modeling and simulation can play a major role in developing standards recommendations for patient compartment layout of automotive ambulances in the United States to improve performance and safety. Acquiring necessary information from relevant stakeholders is shown as a method that can be used to determine user design requirements. The requirements will in turn be used to develop design concepts taking into consideration human interface with the ambulance work environment. The modeling and simulation of clinical care activities in the ambulance can be used to evaluate the design concepts and determine those that would better meet safety and performance requirements.</abstract>
