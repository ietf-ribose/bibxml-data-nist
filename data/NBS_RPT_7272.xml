    <abstract>Measurements of the effects of inserting a brick wall into a radio propagation path are reported. The technique used for measuring insertion loss at frequencies of 518 Mc/s and 1046 Mc/s is described. Distributions of the resulting data indicate the variability of insertion loss with changes in measurement location. The median insertion loss at both frequencies was on the order of 2.5 db.</abstract>
