    <abstract>A workshop in methane super emitter and consensus standards was held in January 2024. This workshop brought together measurement teams, regulators, and a wide range of federal agencies. The use of remote sensing measurement systems on drones, aircraft, and satellites to detect large methane emissions from oil and gas, landfills, and manure management is expanding rapidly. To increase the utility and trust in this data, consensus on the terminology and best practices needs to be developed and documented.</abstract>
