    <abstract>This study is meant to be applied to residential, unitary, air-source, single-speed, vapor compression air-conditioning systems with nominal cooling capacities less than 19 kW (65,000 Btu h-1 or 5.4 tons). In this research, a method for self-training FDD and the new concepts of zone density and operational domain coverage rate are introduced. Various fault-free correlation techniques, such as ANN (artificial neural network), MPR (multivariable polynomial regression), and combined ANN-MPR, are demonstrated and compared for self-training FDD. For the validation of this method, a full FDD algorithm was developed to include eight scenarios (1- fault-free, 2-compressor valve leakage, 3-improper outdoor air flow, 4-improper indoor air flow, 5-liquid-line restriction, 6-refrigerant undercharge, 7-refrigerant overcharge, and 8- presence of non-condensable gases) using data from 72 fault-free and 84 faulty tests.</abstract>
