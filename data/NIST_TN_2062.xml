    <abstract>Mixing rules are proposed and used to correlate well-mixed forest fuel bed fire spread data from the literature using the dimensionless correlations previously developed for singlespecies forest fuel bed fire spread with the help of dimensional analysis and the resulting dimensionless groups. The mixing rules provide means to treat well-mixed fuels as pseudo single-species fuels. As a first attempt with very limited experimental data, the dimensionless correlations for single-species fuels may be applicable to mixed-species fuels with proper mixing rules.</abstract>
