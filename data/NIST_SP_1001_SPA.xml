    <abstract>This course was originally created as a CD-ROM course using Macromedia Authorware (now part of Adobe). At this time, this course will operate better if you run it from your computer. Please download the Zip files and install all of the files from each Part (per language) into a single directory on your computer. If using Windows 7 or later, you will need to specify use compatibility for Windows XP. Please be aware that the Enter key (NOT Tab) must be used after entries throughout the course. Start the course by running the NIST_Intro.exe file.</abstract>
