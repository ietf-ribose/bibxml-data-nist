    <abstract>A regional seminar sponsored by the Korea Standards Research Institute, the National Bureau of Standards, and the U.S. Agency for International Development was held at the new K-SRI Laboratories at Daeduk near Dae Jeon in the Republic of Korea on September 27-28, 1978. The participants representing most of the countries in the South Asian and Western Pacific Region discussed the importance of providing services in measurement science and technology (metrology) to governmental and industrial organizations in the region. The consensus was that a need for a central national capability in metrology existed in countries at all levels of development, and that that central organization could be a focal point for intra- and international cooperation, which alone could lead to compatibility of measurements, a prerequisite for quality control for all kinds of products in domestic and international markets. Australia and New Zealand had established a group of accredited test laboratories to disseminate the accuracies inherent in the national measurement system. Industry was increasingly aware that metrology was essential to development, but the specific needs at appropriate accuracies needed to be established by surveys. The Korean Government strongly supported the establishment of metrological services as is well illustrated by the new K-SRI laboratories.</abstract>
