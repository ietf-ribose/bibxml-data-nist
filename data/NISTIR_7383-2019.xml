    <abstract>This publication contains Good Measurement Procedures (GMP), Good Laboratory Procedures (GLP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for use in calibration laboratories performing volumetric calibrations. It includes procedures for Volume Transfer and Gravimetric Calibrations. This edition includes updates for statistical applications in measurement assurance that were implemented in mass calibrations in 2018.</abstract>
