    <abstract>The purpose of this report is to identify measurement science research needs that are critical to the design of new premise plumbing systems and the operation and retrofit of existing systems to achieve the goals of water and energy efficiency and water quality in an integrated manner. The scope of this research needs assessment includes engineering issues related to system design and operation, and is motivated by the trends and drivers outlined above, particularly the need to update design methods, data, standards, and building codes to reflect the need to increase water efficiency and maintain water quality. The research needs do not focus on water quality, except to the degree that system design, operation, and maintenance impact these processes and the resultant water quality. The research needs also exclude water treatment processes and distribution systems serving buildings, except as these processes and systems impact conditions within buildings. The measurement science research needs in this report were identified with involvement of the broader stakeholder community as described below. While not intended to solely focus on needs in the United States, it should be noted that nearly all the input to this report was gained through interactions with U.S. stakeholders.</abstract>
