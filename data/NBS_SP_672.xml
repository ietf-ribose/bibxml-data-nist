    <abstract>This book is an elementary introduction to the laws of measurements. But the approach is not an abstract discussion of measurements, instead it depends upon getting you to make measurements and, by observing collections of measurements, to discover for yourself some of the properties of measurements. The idea is to learn something about measurement that will be useful-no matter what is being measured. Some hint is given of the devices that scientists and measurements specialists use to get more out of the available equipment. Understanding something about the laws of measurements, a person may be able to get the answers to your own research problems with half the usual amount of work. No young scientist can afford to pass up a topic that may double his scientific achievements.</abstract>
