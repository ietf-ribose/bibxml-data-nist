    <abstract>This report describes the test methodology from LTE impacts on GPS: Test and Metrology Plan developed by National Advanced Spectrum and Communications Test Network (NASCTN), and data that are the result of executing the test method. The fundamental goals in developing the test plan development were: a transparent, reproducible, and well-calibrated test method, sound and statistically- valid data retrieval and processing methods, a clear path from measurement setup to data collection to processed results, and data to inform discussions between different interests on proper measurement requirements. The NASCTN team performed radiated testing to execute the test plan. These efforts amount to a test campaign intended to refine the test method and publish data for the stakeholder community. To this end, the team set out to: provide data of sufficient quality and relevance to support sound decision-making, articulate the importance of measurement uncertainty along with its relationship with the design and execution of the test method, and convey key implementation details that to support future execution of the test method.</abstract>
