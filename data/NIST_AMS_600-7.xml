    <abstract>The report highlights the manufacturing innovation projects developed by the institutes and their partners across the country to combat COVID-19. Manufacturing USA network, comprised of federal agencies and their sponsored manufacturing innovation institutes, assembled and utilized the flexibility, skills and knowledge of their nationwide membership to address issues around domestic PPE, enhanced production of vaccines and treatments, rapid testing, and more in order to begin developing solutions. These public-private-partnerships convened members from industry, academia, and government enabling a rapid response to the developing needs across America based on their access to information and ability to deploy resources. Their relevant and efficient plans, along with $73M in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds distributed through the Department of Commerce and Department of Defense, allowed them to execute dozens of technology development and education and workforce development projects.</abstract>
