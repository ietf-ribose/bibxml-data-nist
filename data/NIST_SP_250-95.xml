    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides calibration services for submitted artifacts for luminous intensity, illuminance, color temperature, total luminous flux, luminous exposure and luminance. Additionally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issues calibrated standards of luminous intensity, luminance, and color temperature. The procedures, equipment, and techniques used to perform these calibrations are described. Detailed estimates and procedures for determining uncertainties of the reported values are also presented along with the internal quality control procedures.</abstract>
