    <abstract>Measurements of the horizontally and vertically polarized field components of VHF transmissions were performed within the urban areas of Muenster (Westphalia) and Hamburg, and the spatial distribution of the ratio of the field components determined. Vertically and horizontally polarized fields obtain cross-polarized components by reflections. The relative intensity of these components depends on the number, size, shape, and composition of the reflecting obstacles. For instance, for vertically polarized transmissions, the ratio of the vertically polarized to the horizontally polarized measured field component is infinite over absolutely flat terrain; however, this ratio may become less than unity if measured in the narrow canyons of a large city. In order to obtain estimates of the spatial distribution of this ratio, two series of measurements were performed during which the received field strength was measured simultaneously on the same spot with a vertical and a horizontal antenna. The results were evaluated by use of statistical analysis.</abstract>
