    <abstract>From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its precursor the National Burearu of Standards (NBS) coordinated what became the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the 1984 and 1985 MMQAP Fat Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum measurement comparability improvement studies: Round Robins I, II, III, and V (selenium and zinc were the only analytes in Round Robin IV). The test samples were: calibration solutions in Round Robins I and II, fortified sera in Round Robin III, and natural plasma in Round Robin V. Participant results were received for: Round Robin I between November 11 and December 24, 1984; Round Robin II between January 14 and February 19, 1985; Round Robin III between March 2 and May 30, 1985; and Round Robin V between August 7 and December 12, 1985.</abstract>
