    <abstract>While opportunities exist with Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional technical approaches. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important, fundamental concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework (BDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 7, contains summaries of the work presented in the other six volumes, an investigation of standards related to Big Data, and an inspection of gaps in those standards.</abstract>
