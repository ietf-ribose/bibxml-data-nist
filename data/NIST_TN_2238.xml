    <abstract>Buildings as a set of electric loads and sources can play an essential role in managing the stability of the power system in a smart grid. Traditionally, buildings assumed a passive rule in the day-to-day operation of the electric grid. Utilities controlled the supply of energy to match the demand of buildings. However, the power distribution grid dynamics are rapidly changing due to an increase in the integration of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and non-linear loads. This technical note only describes the experimental set up for measuring the voltage and current waveform data resulting from the operation of a two-stage air-source heat pump, a clothes dryer, a clothes washer, a refrigerator, a photovoltaic inverter, and a dishwasher. The experimental measurement set up is designed for the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) campus in Gaithersburg, MD. Future results are intended to develop better load forecasting models and analyze the propagation of power quality issues on both sides of the utility meter while operating these appliances. The technical note also provides information about the gain and frequency response of the voltage and current sensors as well as the uncertainty of measurement.</abstract>
