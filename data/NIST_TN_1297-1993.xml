    <abstract>Results of measurements and conclusions derived from them constitute much of the technical information produced by NIST. It is generally agreed that the usefulness of measurement results, and thus much of the information that we provide as an institution, is to a large extent determined by the quality of the statements of uncertainty that accompany them. For example, only if quantitative and thoroughly documented statements of uncertainty accompany the results of NIST calibrations can the users of our calibration services establish their level of traceability to the U.S. standards of measurement maintained at NIST.</abstract>
