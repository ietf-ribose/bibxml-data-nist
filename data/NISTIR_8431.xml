    <abstract>This report summarizes the feedback received on the work of the NIST Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) program on IoT product cybersecurity criteria at a virtual workshop in June 2022. The purpose of this workshop was to obtain feedback on specific considerations and techniques for addressing those considerations around cybersecurity in IoT products. These considerations have broad applicability across IoT product sectors, including the consumer IoT products sector and the industrial IoT sector. For consumer IoT, these considerations arose in moving the criteria presented in Recommended Criteria for Cybersecurity Labeling for Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) Products into draft NIST IR 8425, Profile of the IoT Core Baseline for Consumer IoT Products, along with a discussion paper on the complexity of risk identification for IoT published before the workshop.</abstract>
