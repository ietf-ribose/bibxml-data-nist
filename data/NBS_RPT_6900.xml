    <abstract>Resistance strain gages of the HT-1200 series, manufactured by High Temperature Instruments Corporation, were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics determined were (1) gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing temperature, (3) drift, (4) resistance- temperature relationship, (5) behavior under transient heating conditions, and (6) behavior when subjected to large strains. The results of these tests indicate that these gages, when attached to stainless steel, have a high but somewhat erratic gage factor, low drift at temperatures up to 700¿̐¿ F, and a high but stable temperature coefficient of resistance.
