    <abstract>The report provides a detailed assessment of the capabilities, limitations, and requirements of the National Nonionizing Radiation Measurement System. The priorities of these measurement requirements are assessed according to their ability to contribute (1) to the core competence of determining the electric and magnetic fields of a source or (2) to the associated capabilities for (a) generating and applying reference fields, (b) characterizing sources and reflectors, or (c) recording exposure histories. The report examines these measurement capabilities at all frequencies between dc and 300 GHz.</abstract>
