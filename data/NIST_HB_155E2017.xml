    <abstract>When a weights and measures administrator makes decisions within a specific jurisdiction, it is beneficial to understand the scope of the entire system and to reflect upon methods and practices that have been tested over the years. This handbook was developed for the weights and measures administrator to be used as a reference tool. It is designed to read in sections as needed for a specific situation or to learn piece by piece about the weights and measures system as a whole. The reader is invited to submit comments on any section within this document and to provide updates and corrections as they are identified.</abstract>
