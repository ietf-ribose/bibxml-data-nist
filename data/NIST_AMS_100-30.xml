    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the Standards Requirements Workshop for Natural Language Analysis on May 21, 2019, on the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss the current trends, successes, challenges, and standards requirements needs with respect to natural language document analysis for decision support in manufacturing. This report documents the event including the summarization of inclusive presentations and brainstorming sessions and identification of key themes. The next steps in this effort are presented towards the end of this document, including planning additional forums and meetings to further engage stakeholders on this important topic.</abstract>
