    <abstract>Spectrum monitoring serves as the eyes and ears of the spectrum management process and helps spectrum managers to plan and use frequencies, avoid incompatible usage, and identify sources of harmful interference. The key objective for this research at NIST is to develop a prototype for spectral analysis of both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency (RF) bands, allowing the monitoring of the industrial environment and the access of that information in a simple way for use at industrial facilities with noisy environments and real-time performance requirements, including factories, warehouse and discrete manufacturing, assembly, robotics, oil and gas refineries, water and wastewater treatment plants. This paper provides the specification of industry requirements of spectrum monitoring systems in industrial facilities, so that NIST research will meet these needs.</abstract>
