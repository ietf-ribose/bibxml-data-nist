    <abstract>In this work, we compiled and evaluated eutectic and peritectic phase-transition temperatures for metal-carbon (e.g., Co-C, Re-C) and metal carbide-carbon compounds (e.g., Fe3C-C, HfC2-C) and selected recommended values for possible future use on the International Temperature Scale as primary or secondary fixed points. Most of these phase-transition temperatures are at high temperatures (1400 K to 3000 K) above the highest fixed point, the freezing point of copper (1357.77 K), on the ITS-90 temperature scale, The selected systems include 18 phase-transition temperatures: eight of these have very low uncertainties (0.12 K to 0.27 K) that likely will become primary fixed points on the International Temperature Scale, while ten of these have slightly higher uncertainties (0.4 K to 2.5 K) that may become secondary fixed points. Phase transitions for all other measured metal-carbon systems with higher uncertainties are also provided for completeness.</abstract>
