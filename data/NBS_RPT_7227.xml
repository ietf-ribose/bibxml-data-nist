    <abstract>Modifications in siting criteria are suggested for the VHF Omni-Directional Range navigation aid. Specifically, changes of transmitting antenna height and vertical pattern shape which would decrease undesired ground reflections and increase the range of service are proposed. A short discussion of azimuth errors due to undesired reflections is presented. A method of optimizing the angle of tilt for a given vertical pattern and antenna height is presented. Finally, the results of calculated expected coverage patterns for two tilted arrays and a typical VOR transmitting antenna are compared.</abstract>
