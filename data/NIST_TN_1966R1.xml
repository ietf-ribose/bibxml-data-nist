    <abstract>This report presents local convective boiling heat transfer and Fanning friction factor measurements in a micro-fin tube for R134a and two possible low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant replacements for R134a: R1234yf and R450A. Test section heating was achieved with water in either counterflow or in parallel flow with the test refrigerant to provide for a range of heat fluxes for each thermodynamic quality. An existing correlation from the literature for single and multi-component mixtures was shown to not satisfactorily predict the convective boiling measurements for flow qualities greater than 40 %. Accordingly, a new correlation was developed specifically for the test fluids of this study so that a fair comparison of the heat transfer performance of the low GWP refrigerants to that of R134a could be made. The new correlation was used to compare the heat transfer coefficient of the three test fluids at the same heat flux, saturated refrigerant temperature, and refrigerant mass flux. The resulting example comparison, for the same operating conditions, showed that the heat transfer coefficient of the multi-component R450A and the single-component R1234yf were, on average, 15 % less and 5 % less, respectively, than that of the single-component R134a. Friction factor measurements were also compared to predictions from an existing correlation. A new correlation for the friction factor was developed to provide a more accurate prediction. The measurements and the new models are important for the evaluation of potential low-GWP refrigerants replacements for R134a.</abstract>
