    <abstract>There is ongoing activity within ASTM E57.02 working group WK43218 [1] to develop a documentary standard for point-to-point distance performance evaluation of 3D imaging systems. The Dimensional Metrology Group (DMG) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established facilities to realize all of the test procedures in the current draft. Part 1 [2] of this two-part report presented background information and key findings from an instrument runoff hosted by the DMG in support of this effort. This report (Part 2) describes test facilities established by the DMG, calibration procedures, validation data, and uncertainty budgets.</abstract>
