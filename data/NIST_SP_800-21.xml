    <abstract>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to Federal agencies on how to select cryptographic controls for protecting Sensitive Unclassified1 information. This document focuses on Federal standards documented in Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBs) and the cryptographic modules and algorithms that are validated against these standards. However, to provide additional information, other standards organizations, (e.g., American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO)) are briefly discussed.</abstract>
