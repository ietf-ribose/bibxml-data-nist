    <abstract>This report summarizes the results from the OAGi/NIST Workshop on Open Cloud Architecture for Smart Manufacturing, which was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology on May 5, 2015. The workshop was a forum for manufacturers and providers of IoT technologies, Cloud platforms, and manufacturing services to share their visions, and identify and prioritize barriers to adoption of Cloud-enabling capabilities and technologies, forming a basis for future follow-on events. The report (1) includes summaries as well as full presentations delivered at the workshop; (2) identifies and prioritizes technical issues; (3) summarizes the discussions that took place during the workshop; and (4) provides the conclusions that emerged from the presentations and discussions.</abstract>
