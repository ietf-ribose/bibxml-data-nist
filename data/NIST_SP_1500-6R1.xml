    <abstract>Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked, digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. While opportunities exist with Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional technical approaches, and the growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important fundamental concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework (NBDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 6, summarizes the work performed by the NBD-PWG to characterize Big Data from an architecture perspective, presents the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA) conceptual model, discusses the roles and fabrics of the NBDRA, presents an activities view of the NBDRA to describe the activities performed by the roles, and presents a functional component view of the NBDRA containing the classes of functional components that carry out the activities.</abstract>
