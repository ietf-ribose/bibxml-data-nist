    <abstract>This report is a summary of the work performed by A.P. Robbins, S.M.V. Gwynne and E. D. Kuligowski on a standardized approach for selection of scenarios used in performance-based analysis with fire-safety in mind. This report provides a flowchart that analysts can follow to select the fire-safety scenarios to be used to assess an engineering building design performance for fire hazards. The method published in this report evolved from discussions of the draft of ISO/WD 29761 (Fire-safety engineering - Selection of design occupant behavioural scenarios and design behaviours) that was in development by Working Group 11 of ISO/TC92/SC4 during meetings in 2010. The method incorporates and builds on concepts from ISO/TS 16733 (2006), where appropriate. In preparing this report, some text from ISO/TS 16733 (2006) has been used as a starting point, with permission from the chairs of the ISO Working Group (WG6) and Sub Committee (ISO/TC92/SC4) directly responsible for the standard, and then expanded where applicable and appropriate for the purposes of this document. It is recommended that the reader of this report familiarizes themselves with ISO 16733 (2006) to provide a more comprehensive background for the context and terminology used here.</abstract>
