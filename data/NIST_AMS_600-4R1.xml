    <abstract>Under the authority of the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act (RAMI) of 2014, the Secretary of Commerce established the Network for Manufacturing Innovation, generally called the Manufacturing USA network. The network, along with its manufacturing innovation institutes, makes up the Manufacturing USA program. This document is a revision of the original document published December 2016, and then later revised in October 2018, that chartered the Manufacturing USA network. The charter formalizes the functions of the Manufacturing USA network to facilitate intra-network collaboration, fulfilling the need for an internal information clearinghouse foster robust communication between the network and external stakeholders, serving as an external information clearinghouse for the program.</abstract>
