    <abstract>This report summarizes the results of the workshop entitled “Empowering Small and Medium Size Enterprises Through Effective Additive Manufacturing Data Management.” NIST co-hosted the event in partnership with the National Manufacturing Innovative Institute for additive manufacturing, America Makes, the Regional Additive Manufacturing Partnership of Maryland (RAMPMD) and Pilgrim Consulting, LLC. The workshop explored how best to empower the productive working relationship of small and medium size Enterprises (SMEs) with top tier manufacturers through effective additive manufacturing (AM) data management by examining the AM data management “Pain Points” associated with SME interactions with large system integrators (LSI) and government procurement agencies. It has found that the complex, diverse and frequently parochial relations between LSIs, SMEs, and customers tend to inhibit facile working relationships. This increases the cost and time required to bring a product to market while concomitantly inhibiting innovation and profitability. The synopsis of the working group recommendations provides some specific actionable items for consideration.</abstract>
