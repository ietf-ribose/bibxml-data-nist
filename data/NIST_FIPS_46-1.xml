    <abstract>The selective application of technological and related procedural safeguards is an important responsibility of every Federal organization in providing adequate security to its ADP systems. This publication provides a standard to be used by Federal organizations when these organizations specify that cryptographic protection ia to be used for 11emitive or valuable computer data. Protection of computer data during transmission between electronic components or while in storage may be necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the Information represented by that data. The standard specifies an encryption algorithm which is to be implemented in an el.ectronJc device for use in Federal ADP systems and networks. The algorithm uniquely defines the mathematical steps required to transform computer data into a cryptographic cipher. It also specifies the steps required to transform the cipher back to its original form. A device performing this algorithm may be used in many applications areas where cryptographic data protection is needed. Within the context of a total security program comprising physical security procedures, good information management practices and computer system/network access controls, the Data Encryption Standard is being made available for use by Federal agencies. This revision supersedes FIPS 46.</abstract>
