    <abstract>This paper explores a low-cost method to bridge analog public safety Land mobile radio (LMR) systems into a standards based Long Term Evolution (LTE) MCPTT system. Design goals included robustness, cost, and the creation of a system that closely conforms to released and future standards. A proof of concept prototype that successfully bridges an analog LMR system with a standards compliant LTE based MCPTT system was developed and tested. The results and design details will be covered in this paper.</abstract>
