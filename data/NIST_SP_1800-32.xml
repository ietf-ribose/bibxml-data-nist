    <abstract>The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the application of instrumentation and connected sensors and other devices to machinery and vehicles in the transport, energy, and other critical infrastructure sectors. In the energy sector, distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar photovoltaics including sensors, data transfer and communications systems, instruments, and other commercially available devices that are networked together. DERs introduce information exchanges between a utility's distribution control system and the DERs to manage the flow of energy in the distribution grid.</abstract>
