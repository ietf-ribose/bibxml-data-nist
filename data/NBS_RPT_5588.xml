    <abstract>In recent years there has been an increased utilization of meteoro¿̐¿ logical information for the prediction of radio field strengths at fre¿̐¿ quencies of 50 Me. and above. Various studies have used radiosonde measurements to describe the effect of elevated superrefractive layers _1/_, the gross gradient in the first kilometer of the earth's atmosphere _2,_3/_, and, more recently, it has been shown that the long term mean value of the radio transmission loss may be represented as a linear function of the surface value of the radio refractivity as derived from surface weather observations. The refractivity, Ns is given by _8/_: N = (n - 1) 10^6 = 77.6/T [ Ps + 4810 es RH/T ] where P is the station pressure in millibars, RH is the percent of the saturation vapor pressure, es , in millibars at the absolute temperatures T, in degrees Kelvin, and n is the refractive index. The data used in the present study were obtained from the Kopenhagener Schluessel deck of the punched card library of the National Weather Records Center, U. S. Weather Bureau. The location of the weather stations used in this study are shown on Fig. 1, and are specified in more detail in Table I. The choice of stations was made so as to give detailed geographic coverage for the arbitrarily chosen two year period.</abstract>
