    <abstract>The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) glossary of terms related to trustworthy and responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) intends to promote a common understanding and effective communication among individuals and organizations seeking to operationalize trustworthy and responsible AI through approaches such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). The glossary, like the AI RMF, is non-sector specific and use-case agnostic, designed to be flexible for all organizations and sectors of society to use. The continuing aim of the glossary is to provide a common language to improve discussions related to AI and to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.</abstract>
