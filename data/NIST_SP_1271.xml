    <abstract>This document intends to provide direction and guidance to those organizations in any sector or community seeking to improve cybersecurity risk management via utilization of the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework or the Framework). Cybersecurity is an important and amplifying component of an organization s overall risk management process. The Framework enables organizations regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity sophistication to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improve security and resilience. Through implementation of the Framework, organizations can better identify, assess, and manage their cybersecurity risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives.</abstract>
