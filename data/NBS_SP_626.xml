    <abstract>Members of the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Group of the International Committee for Radionuclide Metrology agreed in 1979 to collect the nuclear data from any measurements in their laboratories that were pertinent to the calibration of the efficiency of germanium spectrometer systems. This report is composed of the contributions from 14 laboratories, as listed in part II. If a self-contained contribution was received, it has been incorporated without editing. Less formal communications, or references to published articles, are discussed in short comments prepared by the compilers. Part IV is a compilation of a selected portion of the data, arranged by radionuclide.</abstract>
