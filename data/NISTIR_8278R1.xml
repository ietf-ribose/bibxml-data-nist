    <abstract>Information and communications technology (ICT) domains – such as cybersecurity, privacy, and Internet of Things (IoT) – have many requirements and recommendations made by national and international standards, guidelines, frameworks, and regulations. An Online Informative Reference (OLIR) provides a standardized expression of the relationships between concepts in such documents. OLIRs provide a consistent and authoritative way of specifying relationships that can be used by both humans and automation. The National OLIR Program is a NIST effort to encourage and facilitate subject matter experts in defining OLIRs and to provide a centralized location for displaying and comparing OLIRs. This report provides an overview of the National OLIR Program, explains the basics of OLIRs and the benefits they can provide, and shows how anyone can access and use OLIRs.</abstract>
