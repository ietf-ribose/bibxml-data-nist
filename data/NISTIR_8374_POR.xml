    <abstract>Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization s data and demand payment to restore access. Attackers may also steal an organization s information and demand an additional payment in return for not disclosing the information to authorities, competitors, or the public. This Ransomware Profile identifies the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 security objectives that support identifying, protecting against, detecting, responding to, and recovering from ransomware events. The profile can be used as a guide to managing the risk of ransomware events. That includes helping to gauge an organization s level of readiness to counter ransomware threats and to deal with the potential consequences of events.</abstract>
