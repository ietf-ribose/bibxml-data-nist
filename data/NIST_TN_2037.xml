    <abstract>The Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been designed and constructed to demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to perform optimization of control systems in commercial buildings. This technical note presents an assessment of the measurement uncertainty of instrumentation in the air system of the IBAL. The total uncertainty is calculated by combining this time-dependent variability with the uncertainty of the instrumentation.</abstract>
