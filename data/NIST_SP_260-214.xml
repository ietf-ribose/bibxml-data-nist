    <abstract>NIST Reference Material (RM) 8256 Wild-caught Coho Salmon, RM 8257 Aquacultured Coho Salmon, RM 8258 Wild-caught Shrimp and RM 8259 Aquacultured Shrimp were generated for use in authentication, nutrition and food safety-related determinations of crude fat and fatty acids. Each unit consists of two jars containing 6 to 8 g of fresh frozen powder homogenate. RMs of the same type (e.g. fish or shellfish) can be used individually or in tandem for comparative studies. This publication documents the sourcing, measurement results and statistical analysis employed in characterizing each material.</abstract>
