    <abstract>Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2034, Holmium Oxide Solution Wavelength Standard (240 nm to 650 nm), was produced periodically from 1985 to 2015. The expiration date for the units of each production run increased with experience until 1995 when a period of ten years was established. This report describes a study of legacy samples from every production run over the thirty-year period that established that the band locations in all samples have not varied outside of their established uncertainties. These results support the extension of the expected stability of SRM 2034 holmium oxide solution in dilute perchloric acid to a period of at least 30 years.</abstract>
