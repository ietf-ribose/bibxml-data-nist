    <abstract>The Symposium on the Department of Energy's Intermediate Future Forecasting System IFFS was held in Washington, D.C. on August 19, 1982. It was funded by the Energy Information Administration of The Department of Energy (DOE) and organized by the Operations Research Division of the National Bureau of Standards. The purposes of the Symposium were (1) to present to the energy community details of DOE's new energy market model IFFS and (2) to have an open forum in which IFFS and its major elements could be reviewed and critiqued by external experts. DOE speakers discussed the total system, its software design, and the modeling aspects of oil and gas supply, refineries, electric utilities, coal, and the energy economy. Invited experts critiqued each of these topics and offered suggestions for modifications and improvement. This volume documents the Proceedings (papers and discussion) of the Symposium.</abstract>
