    <abstract>At frequencies above 50 Me climate, meteorological conditions in the troposphere, and the shape of terrain irregularities play the principal roles in determining the strength and distance that a signal will be propagated. A catalog of tropospheric propagation radio field strength data covering approximately 200 propagation paths for distances from 33 to 61 6 miles and frequencies from 41 to 1046 Me is presented in order to disseminate the information available at the National Bureau of Standards.</abstract>
