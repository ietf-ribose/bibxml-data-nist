    <abstract>Two 3D Imaging Systems Performance Evaluation Workshops have been held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the first in 2003 and the second in 2005. These workshops were conducted in an effort to determine the need for standard test methods for evaluating 3D imaging systems (previously referred to as LADAR systems), to determine the types of measurements and test methods required, to provide a forum to discuss the on-going efforts in this area, and to initiate the process towards standardization of these test methods or protocols. To continue the effort, NIST conducted a 3rd Workshop on the Performance Evaluation of 3D Imaging systems on March 2-3, 2006. This report presents the proceedings from the third workshop.</abstract>
