    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed the Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) to demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to optimize the control of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings. The goal of the optimization is to improve the economic and energy performance of building systems while maintaining occupant comfort. This paper describes the design of, and the equipment in, the airside system of the IBAL.</abstract>
