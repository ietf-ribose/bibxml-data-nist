    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a Model-Based Enterprise Summit from April 12-14, 2016 with the intention of identifying challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in manufacturing and quality assurance where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in the product's lifecycle. This 3D model is considered a model-based definition (MBD) and acts as a digital thread of sorts to weave and link all the phases of the product lifecycle together. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and NIST developed a tool to help organizations assess whether they are ready for an MBE or smart manufacturing platform. The tool was appropriately named: MBE Capability Index Assessment Tool. As part of the summit, NIST was also interested in collecting input specific to the MBE Capability Index Assessment Tool and the consideration for developing a guidebook for the tool.</abstract>
