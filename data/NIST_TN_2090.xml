    <abstract>A lump-capacitance heat transfer model was developed to model the operation of a slug calorimeter constructed of metal with a Curie point. The resulting formula has been successfully used to infer total heat flux to a metal structural member in a fire by temporally monitoring the internal temperature rise during the heat-up phase of the metal member (slug) with embedded thermocouples. The formula derived is applicable to slug calorimeters made from metals with or without a Curie point.</abstract>
