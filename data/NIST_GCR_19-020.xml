    <abstract>In August 2018, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense program, and the Water Research Foundation (WRF) organized a Measurement Science Roadmap Workshop for Water Use Efficiency and Water Quality in Premise Plumbing Systems (hereafter referred to as the Premise Plumbing Workshop) with representatives from industry, academia, government, utilities, standards and codes organizations, and other research and stakeholder organizations. The intent of the workshop was to identify and organize measurement science research needed to improve the efficiency and quality of water delivered by premise plumbing systems. The workshop results, along with feedback from stakeholder engagement efforts, will form the basis for potential future program development within multiple public and private sector agencies and organizations.</abstract>
