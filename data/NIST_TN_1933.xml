    <abstract>Achieving national goals of net zero energy buildings requires substantial reduction in the energy consumption of commercial building systems. In 2015, commercial buildings consumed 18 % of the total energy consumed in the U.S. [1]. Although significant progress has been made in the integration of building control systems through the development of standard communication protocols, such as BACnet and BACnet/IP, little progress has been made in making them intelligent about optimizing building system-level performance. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to perform this optimization and to develop a research infrastructure suitable for development and testing of advanced agent-based optimization techniques that can improve the energy and comfort performance of building systems. Towards that goal, the Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been constructed to act as a testbed for these intelligent control algorithms. This note describes the design of a portion of that facility.</abstract>
