    <abstract>The public safety community is in a period of great transition. Over the next 20 years, technology advancements will enable data, video, and eventually voice communications to migrate from Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks to a single nationwide Long Term Evolution (LTE) broadband network, the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Emerging technologies within this new infrastructure present opportunities and challenges for public safety, and the process of modernizing responder communications requires significant coordination and planning. To facilitate the transition from LMR to LTE, the National Institute of Standards and Technology⁰₉s (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program initiated a research and development (R) planning process to determine what technology investments are of highest priority to the public safety community. This document summarizes the results of PSCR⁰₉s Public Safety Enhanced User Interface R Roadmap. This report is the third of several technology roadmaps that PSCR has developed over the past several years to better inform the investment decisions of R organizations supporting the public safety community. This document aims to assist in planning for public safety communications research and optimize the allocation of the</abstract>
