    <abstract>Version 4.0 of this database (SRD 64) provides values of differential elastic-scattering cross sections, total elastic-scattering cross sections, phase shifts, and transport cross sections for elements with atomic numbers from 1 to 96 and for electron energies between 50 eV and 300 keV (in steps of 1 eV). Knowledge of elastic-scattering effects is important for the development of theoretical models for quantitative analysis by Auger-electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microprobe analysis, and analytical electron microscopy. An analysis of available elastic-scattering cross-section data has been published [A. Jablonski, F. Salvat, and C. J. Powell, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 33, 409 (2004)].</abstract>
