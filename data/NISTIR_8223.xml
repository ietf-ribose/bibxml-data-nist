    <abstract>Since reporting began in 1997, 94 new GUS in lieu of VCS have been reported, and of this number, only 73 remain in lieu of private sector standards. The effectiveness of the NTTAA and Circular A-119 in encouraging an enhanced awareness and acceptance of private sector standards by federal agencies is demonstrated by the low numbers of reported new GUS used in lieu of VCS and the repeated review of opportunities to replace existing GUS with VCS. These activities suggest that federal agencies are increasingly likely to use standards developed by the private sector to meet their mission needs. In accordance with its coordination role as defined in the NTTAA and Circular A-119, NIST continues to assist federal agencies and their stakeholders with standards and conformity assessment information, program support, guidance, and policy concerns. NIST hosts https://standards.gov, which offers ongoing practical guidance and information needed by agencies to implement the NTTAA successfully and report standards activities as required by the NTTAA and Circular A-119. This report fulfills the annual reporting requirements of both the NTTAA and Circular A-119.</abstract>
