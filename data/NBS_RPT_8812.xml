    <abstract>The experimental property differences of ortho and para hydrogen and their mixtures as reported in the world literature for temperatures below 300¿̐¿K are tabulated. Properties included are specific heat, velocity of sound, thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, vapor pressure, saturated liquid and saturated vapor densities, and latent heat of vaporization. Pertinent comments regarding the experimental methods employed, the pressure and temperature range of the data, and the accuracy of the data are included when available.</abstract>
