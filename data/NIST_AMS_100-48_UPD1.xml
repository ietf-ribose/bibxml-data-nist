    <abstract>Currently, global economies are using and contaminating resources faster than they can be regenerated. This resource depletion strains the economy and society today and into the future and is largely due to a series of misaligned incentives. Solving this problem begins by identifying these misalignments, identifying feasible solutions that realign incentives or addresses the results of the misalignment. This report examines the economics of a circular economy, focusing more on issues related to standards and technologies which might facilitate increased environmental sustainability.</abstract>
