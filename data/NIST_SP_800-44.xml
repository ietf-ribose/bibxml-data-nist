    <abstract>Web servers maintained for public use are normally the most targeted and attacked hosts on an organization's network. Thus, it is essential to secure Web servers and the network infrastructure that supports them. This document has been developed to assist federal departments and agencies, state agencies, and commercial organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure public Web servers. It presents generic security principles and covers details specific to the various components of Web content, Web applications, and Web servers. It also includes examples that address two of the more popular Web server applications running respectively on Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems: Apache and Internet Information Server.</abstract>
