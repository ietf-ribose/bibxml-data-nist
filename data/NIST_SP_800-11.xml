    <abstract>A significant portion of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications relies on the Public Switched Network (PSN). Therefore, NS/EP telecommunications is concerned with the protection of the PSN to ensure that telecommunications services are available and reliable. Service vendors, equipment manufacturers, and the federal government are concerned that vulnerabilities in the PSN could be exploited and result in disruptions or degradation of service. To address these threats, NIST is assisting the Office of the Manager, National Communications System (OMNCS), in the areas of computer and network security research and development. NIST is investigating the vulnerabilities and related security issues that result from use of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Network Architecture (ONA). This report provides an overview of ONA, describes NS/EP telecommunications security concerns, and describes NS/EP telecommunications security concerns that the FCC's ONA requirement introduces into the PSN.</abstract>
