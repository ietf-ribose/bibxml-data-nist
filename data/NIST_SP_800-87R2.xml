    <abstract>The Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12 called for new standards to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical and logical access to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors, (Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201)) was developed to establish standards for identity credentials. This document, Special Publication 800-87 (SP 800-87), provides the organizational codes necessary to establish the PIV Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (PIV FASC-N) that is required to be included in the FIPS 201 Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID) and is a companion document to FIPS 201.
