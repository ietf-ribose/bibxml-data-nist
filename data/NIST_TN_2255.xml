    <abstract>In this report, we document the models and dimensional traceability of our 2.4 mm coaxial airline standards for performing multiline thru-reflect-line calibrations up to 50 GHz using vector network analyzers. We identify the equations used in our models of the transmission-line standards and present a method for determining a coaxial lineâ€™s metal conductivity using a closed-form solution relating it to the propagation constant. Next, we provide details of the traceable dimensional measurements and associated uncertainties of our 2.4 mm airline standards. And finally, we describe how our software, the NIST Microwave Uncertainty Framework, is used to implement physical models of calibration standards and propagate these systematic uncertainties to the calibrated scattering-parameters of a device under test. We include a measurement example for illustrative purposes.</abstract>
