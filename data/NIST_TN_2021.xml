    <abstract>The Transactive Energy (TE) Challenge Phase II Scenario was developed in a multi-step process in collaboration with industry experts. The Scenario enables comparison of results from different TE simulations and different TE approaches. The Scenario includes a common electric grid definition including attached loads and generators, weather, and reporting metrics. This document and the files that it references serve as a repository for future use.</abstract>
