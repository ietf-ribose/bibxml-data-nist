    <abstract>Resistance strain gages of the S-700 series, manufactured by the Instruments Division of the Budd Company (formerly the Tatnall Measuring Systems Company) were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics determined were (1) gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing temperature, (3) drift, (4) resistance-temperature relationship, (5) behavior when subjected to large strains and (6) behavior under transient heating conditions¿̐¿ The results of these tests indicate that, when attached to stainless steel, the use of these gages may be limited by the effect of gage history on the gage factor; the high drift rate at about 800¿̐¿ F; the high temperature coefficient of resistance, especially at about 1000¿̐¿ F; and the difficulty in maintaining a good bond to stainless steel at 1500¿̐¿ F.</abstract>
