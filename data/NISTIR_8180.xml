    <abstract>The purpose of rigid-body registration is to find a rotation and translation which transforms one coordinate frame to another. The procedure requires measurement of common points (fiducials) in both frames. Noise and possible bias in the acquired locations of fiducials adversely affect the quality of registration. While the influence of noise can be mitigated by taking repeated measurements, bias remains in the mean locations of fiducials and distorts the rigid-body condition. The condition may be also violated when fiducials are attached to a non-rigid object. We present a numerical method which calculates corrections in the locations of measured fiducials and leads to the restoration of the rigid-body condition. Once the registration transformation is calculated using the corrected fiducials, it can be used to transform other points which are measured only in one coordinate frame (target points). We estimate the corrections in these points by linearly interpolating the corrections from neighboring fiducials. After interpolated corrections are added to the target locations, there was a decrease in the target registration error. The proposed method was evaluated using three different datasets acquired with three different instruments.</abstract>
