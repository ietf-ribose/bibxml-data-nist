    <abstract>With cloud computing in the mainstream, there is a preponderance of cloud based services in the market and the choices for consumers increase daily. However, comparing the service offerings between cloud service providers is not a straightforward exercise. As part of the decision-making framework for moving to the cloud, having data on measurable capabilities, for example - quality of service, availability and reliability, give the cloud service customer the tools and opportunity to make informed choices and to gain an understanding of the service being delivered. A metric provides knowledge about characteristics of a cloud property through both its definition (e.g. expression, unit, rules) and the values resulting from the measurement of the property. This document proposes concepts and a model to represent cloud service metrics. This model represents the information needed to understand a targeted cloud property and which constraints should be applied during measurement</abstract>
