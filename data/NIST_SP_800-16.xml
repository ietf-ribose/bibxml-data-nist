    <abstract>This document supersedes NIST SP 500-172, Computer Security Training Guidelines, published in 1989. The new document supports the Computer Security Act (Public Law 100-235) and OMB Circular A-130 Appendix III requirements that NIST develop and issue computer security training guidance. This publication presents a new conceptual framework for providing information technology (IT) security training. This framework includes the IT security training requirements appropriate for today's distributed computing environment and provides flexibility for extension to accommodate future technologies and the related risk management decisions.</abstract>
