    <abstract>This report describes a phase detector circuit capable of providing a large DC output voltage isolated from ground. The Circuit employs a gated beam vacuum tube or similar coincidence device to produce a carrier signal amplitude-modulated as a function of the relative phase shift between two input signals. The resulting carrier may be coupled across any desired DC potential, and then demodulated with a simple AM detector. Output voltages as high as 500 volts have been obtained with the circuit.</abstract>
