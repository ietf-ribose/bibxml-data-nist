    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is commencing the implementation of certain statistical procedures, namely errors-in-variables regression and Monte Carlo uncertainty evaluation, into the data analysis and reporting for the force calibration service provided by the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML). This document is intended to serve as an overview of these procedures to the users of NIST's force calibration service, by presenting computational details of the analyses and introducing the corresponding format for the force calibration report.</abstract>
