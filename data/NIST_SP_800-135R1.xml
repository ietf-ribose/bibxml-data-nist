    <abstract>Cryptographic keys are vital to the security of internet security applications and protocols. Many widely-used internet security protocols have their own application-specific Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that are used to generate the cryptographic keys required for their cryptographic functions. This Recommendation provides security requirements for those KDFs.</abstract>
