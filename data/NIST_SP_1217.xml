    <abstract>For two days beginning on March 8, 2017, a planning workshop entitled Electron Microscopy Frontiers: Opportunities and Challenges was hosted by the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Grass root efforts from electron microscopists across three MML divisions (642, 643, and 647) and two campuses (Boulder and Gaithersburg) co-organized this event. The organizers (in alphabetical order) John Bonevich, Ann Chiaramonti Debay, Andrew Herzing, Robert Keller, and June Lau, contributed equally to this workshop as well as this final report. The information contained herein is based in part on the results of the workshop, which was attended by stakeholders working in the field of electron microscopy (EM), as well as non-microscopy experts in selected fields. This report presents the expert perspectives of the participants, but is not intended to be taken as prevailing opinion across the represented field. Ideas from a series of conversations among the organizers prior to, and following the workshop, are also reflected in this writing.</abstract>
