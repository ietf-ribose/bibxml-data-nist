    <abstract>The 104th Annual Meeting of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) was held July 14 - 18, 2019, at the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee Hotel, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The theme of the meeting was 'Assuring Equity in the Marketplace: NIST and NCWM, Partners with a Shared Mission.'
