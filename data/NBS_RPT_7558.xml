    <abstract>Type F20 resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Shinkoh Communications Industry Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan and sold in the United States by the Metrix Company, were evaluated at temperatures up to 400¿̐¿ F. The results of these tests indicate that the gage factor at 75¿̐¿ F is within 3 percent of the manufacturer's nominal value; that the gage factor at elevated temperatures varies considerably from gage to gage; that the gages are able to sustain strains of 0.004 without failure at temperatures as high as 300¿̐¿ F; that the drift is low at temperatures as high as 400¿̐¿ F; that the temperature sensitivity is repeatable; and that the resistance to ground is a function of the thermal history of the gage.</abstract>
