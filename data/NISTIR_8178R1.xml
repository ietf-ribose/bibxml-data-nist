    <abstract>This guide addresses the compliance requirements for basic cosmetics and soap. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD Act) defines cosmetics as articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body ... for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance (FD Act, sec. 201(i)). Cosmetic products may include skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial make-up preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, and deodorants, as well as any substance that is intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product.</abstract>
