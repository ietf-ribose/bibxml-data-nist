    <abstract>Instrument performance is evaluated through performing a set of tests, and the test results determine whether the instrument meets or fails the standard requirements. The performance test data are analyzed and usually point estimate and confidence bounds are calculated, on which a testing decision is made. This chapter provides recipes of statistical analysis of the test data, including estimation of probability of detection or identification, or false alarm rate, and particularly on how various confidence intervals and confidence bounds are computed based on sound statistical principles.</abstract>
