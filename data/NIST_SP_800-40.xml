    <abstract>Timely patching is critical to maintain the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of IT systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is the most common mistake made by information technology (IT) professionals. To help address this growing problem, this special publication recommends methods to help organizations have an explicit and documented patching and vulnerability policy and a systematic, accountable, and documented process for handling patches. This document also covers areas such as prioritizing patches, obtaining patches, testing patches, and applying patches.</abstract>
