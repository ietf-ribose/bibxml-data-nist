    <abstract>This report documents the steps followed to calibrate an all-wheel steer Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) for optimal performance. Proper calibration of the steering and drive parameters of an AGV are critical for accurate dead-reckoning navigation, and improves the performance of an AGV servoing based on navigational information. Calibration of the navigation system alignment is also important for proper control of the AGV. This report discusses the calibration of the distance encoder, the steering offsets, and the sensor mounting angle on the AGV. Manual methods for performing the AGV calibration are discussed that require a minimum of specialized equipment.</abstract>
