    <abstract>Long-Term Evolution (LTE) supporting Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a feature introduced in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) release 12. D2D communication is critical in public safety applications, which enables communication among first responders when the network infrastructure may not be available. In order to characterize the performance of D2D communications using network simulation tool (e.g. ns-3), accurate physical layer error model is important. In this document, we present our D2D physical channel simulations to study the BLock Error Rate (BLER) performance of the physical channels. We also demonstrate how to integrate the simulation results into network simulator to perform system level simulation.</abstract>
