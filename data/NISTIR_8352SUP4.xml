    <abstract>This report provides supplemental information to NISTIR 8352 Bitemark Analysis: A NIST Scientific Foundation Review. Publicly available resources relating to bitemark analysis were collected to assist in the review of the scientific foundations of bitemark analysis conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Over 400 sources were collected from literature searches and input from previous efforts by the National Institute of Justice Forensic Technology Center of Excellence, the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO), and other public resources. This reference list is meant as a resource for the odontology community and interested stakeholders but does not represent an exhaustive compilation of the literature pertaining to bitemark analysis.</abstract>
