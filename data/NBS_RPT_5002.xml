    <abstract>The reflection from a wire grid parallel to a plane interface is considered. The respective media are homogeneous and either or both can be dissipative. The grid is composed of thin equi-spaced wires of finite conductivity. The plane wave solution for arbitrary incidence is then generalized for cylindrical-wave excitation. The energy absorbed from a magnetic line source by a grid situated on the surface of a dissipative half-space is treated in some detail. This latter problem is a two-dimensional analogy of a vertical antenna with a radial wire ground system.</abstract>
