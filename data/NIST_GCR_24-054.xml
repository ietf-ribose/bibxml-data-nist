    <abstract>Socio-economic forces in conjunction with the emergence and proliferation of technical advances in both hardware and software are changing the landscape of manufacturing robotics. This document discusses the factors that are altering the development and deployment ecosystems, specifically as they affect the measurement science necessary for enabling broader adoption of more capable and “smarter” robots for U.S. manufacturers.</abstract>
