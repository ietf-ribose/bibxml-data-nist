    <abstract>This report presents a long-range plan for roofing research. The plan was developed in response to a need for roofing research addressing major materials problems and changes in low-sloped roofing materials technology. The intent of the plan is to establish the technical basis for developing standards and minimum levels of performance to assist in the selection of cost-effective and durable roofing materials. Four major areas of needed research are identified: low-sloped roofing systems, roofing membranes including single-ply and built-up, thermal insulation for roofing systems, and condition assessment and repair of roofs. Within each research area, a goal is given as well as a number of objectives to achieve the goal. A recommended approach to accomplish each objective is also given.</abstract>
