    <abstract>This publication describes a basis for establishing principles, concepts, activities, and tasks for engineering trustworthy secure systems. Such principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be effectively applied within systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless of the system's purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or the stage of its system life cycle. The intent of this publication is to advance systems engineering in developing trustworthy systems for contested operational environments (generally referred to as systems security engineering) and to serve as a basis for developing educational and training programs, professional certifications, and other assessment criteria.</abstract>
