    <abstract>This guide describes how to use the STEP File Analyzer, a software tool that analyzes and generates a spreadsheet or a set of CSV (comma-separated value) files from a STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data) file. The spreadsheets simplify inspecting information in the STEP file at an entity and attribute level. STEP files can also be checked for conformance to recommended practices for Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) representation, PMI presentation, and validation properties. The STEP File Analyzer also generates visualizations of PMI annotations, parts modeled with tessellated geometry, and finite element models. The STEP File Analyzer is developed as part of the Digital Thread for Smart Manufacturing project in the Engineering Laboratory's Smart Manufacturing Operations Planning and Control Program (SMOPAC). The software was first released in 2012. This guide is based on version 2.30 of the software.</abstract>
