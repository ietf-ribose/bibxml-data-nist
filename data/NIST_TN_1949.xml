    <abstract>We describe preliminary models for the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension for pure fluids that are constituents of four surrogate fuels for ultralow-sulfur diesel fuels developed under the auspices of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC). These fluids do not presently have published reference fluid quality models in the open literature, so we provide here preliminary models based on available data as an interim measure to allow calculations of these properties for both the pure fluids and the four surrogate mixtures. Comparisons with selected experimental pure fluid data are given, and text files compatible with the NIST REFPROP computer program are included as supplementary material. We also present tabulations of the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension along the bubble point for four surrogate fuels.</abstract>
