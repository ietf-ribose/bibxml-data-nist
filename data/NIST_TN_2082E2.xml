    <abstract>This report documents a series of time-averaged gas species measurements made along the centerline of methanol, ethanol, acetone, methane, and propane pool fires steadily burning in a quiescent environment. All gas species measurements are obtained using a Gas Chromatograph/ Mass Spectrometer System (GC/MS) for gas samples extracted at various heights above the fire and repeated at least twice at each location. Gas species volume fractions are determined via the GC/MS using predetermined calibration factors. Soot mass fractions are simultaneously measured during the gas sampling process. The gas species volume and soot mass fractions are compared at different heights within the fire and across a variety of different fuels. Other fire parameters are measured as well, including time-averaged temperature and velocity measurements and mass burning rates.</abstract>
