    <abstract>This companion report summarizes the discussion and subsequent actions from a supplementary one-day session following the NIST Food Safety Workshop held in October 2019. The supplementary session was open to National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs), commercial reference material and reference standard producers, and NIST staff engaged in developing measurement services and standards for food safety. The main goals of the session were to synthesize the key takeaways obtained from discussions during the 3-day Food Safety Workshop focused on four main food safety pillars (microbiological contaminants, chemical contaminants, food allergens, and authenticity); disseminate the unique challenges, capabilities, and interests for each institute and organization; and then develop cooperative solutions in five specific global food safety challenge areas, as delineated from the four pillars: microbiological contaminants, allergens and authenticity, inorganic contaminants, pesticides residues, and non-pesticide organic contaminants.</abstract>
