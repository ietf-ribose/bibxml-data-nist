    <abstract>These proceedings are the compilation of 21 papers presented at a seminar on Traceability for Ionizing Radiation Measurements held at the National Bureau of Standards, Gaithersburg, MD, on May 8-9, 1980. General concepts for traceability were presented from several perspectives. The national standards for radiation dosimetry, radioactivity measurements, and neutron measurements were described. Specific programs for achieving traceability to the national standards for radiation measurements in medical, occupational, and environmental applications were summarized.</abstract>
