    <abstract>This report deals with the prediction of service volumes (i. e., service ranges in three dimensions) for VOR and TACAN air navigation facilities in the presence of noise and interfering stations. Propagation mechanisms applicable to the frequency ranges employed are discussed first, together with calculation of transmission loss and its variability. Second, the statistical treatment of the interference problem is explained. Finally, it is shown how service volumes are determined based on transmission loss and its variations, specified or assumed criteria on signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratio, and the spatial relations of the aircraft, the desired facility, and the undesired facility. The results of the entire study are presented in graphical form. Detailed procedures, mathematical formulas, and computer programs used are discussed in the Appendix.</abstract>
