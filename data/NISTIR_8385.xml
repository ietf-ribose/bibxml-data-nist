    <abstract>NIST launched a CannaQAP in 2020 to improve the comparability of the analytical measurements in forensic and Cannabis (hemp and marijuana) testing laboratories. CannaQAP is an interlaboratory study mechanism that is similar to a proficiency testing scheme; however, the focus is towards education without assigning pass/fail grades to anonymized participants. CannaQAP helps inform NIST about the current measurement capabilities and challenges to assist in the design and characterization of Cannabis RMs. Exercise 1 of CannaQAP focused on the determination of cannabinoids including ?9-THC, THCA, total THC, CBD, CBDA, total CBD, and up to 13 additional cannabinoids in two hemp oils. This report provides a detailed description of the results of this exercise.</abstract>
