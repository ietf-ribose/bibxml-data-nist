    <abstract>This document summarizes conclusions from a workshop focused on Interoperability of Web Computational Plugins for Large Microscopy Image Analyses. The workshop conclusions are classified as practical recommendations and agreements on development and future research related to (1) containerization of execution code, (2) data storage, (3) interoperability requirements of workflow engines for running containerized plugins, (4) standard packaging of web user interface modules, and (5) security of container-based distribution.</abstract>
