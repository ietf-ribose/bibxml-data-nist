    <abstract>A series of fourteen experiments on six 9 ft. 12 ft. (2.7 m 3.7 m) shear wall specimens consisting of cold-formed steel framing sheathed on one side with light-gauge steel adhered to gypsum board and on the opposite side with plain gypsum board were conducted at the National Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The specimens were subjected to varying sequences of simulated seismic shear deformation and fire loading to study the influence of structure-fire interactions on the lateral load capacity of the walls. The test program was designed to complement a parallel test series to investigate a full-scale six-story building subjected to earthquakes and fires. The test results showed that the fire loading caused a shift in the failure mode of the walls from local to global bucking of the sheet metal with an accompanying 35 % reduction of load capacity.</abstract>
