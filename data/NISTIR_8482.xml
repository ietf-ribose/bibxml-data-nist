    <abstract>The 2023 National Institute of Standards and Technology Environmental Scan provides an analysis of key external factors that could impact NIST and the fulfillment of its mission in coming years. The analyses were conducted through three separate lenses: Societal  Political(Sec. 2), Investment  Geopolitical (Sec. 3), and Technology  Science (Sec. 4). Most of the issues discussed in the previous environmental scans conducted in 2018 and 2020 are still relevant, but a number of key issues have emerged in society that will impact NIST since the writing of those reports. Societal, political, financial, and workforce issues will challenge NIST to maintain and advance its leadership in metrology, standards, and technology. However, a broad range of emerging technology issues present opportunities for NIST to have significant impact in advancing the nationâ€™s innovation and industrial competitiveness.</abstract>
