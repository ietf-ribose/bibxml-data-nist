    <abstract>Cooking and baking using a kitchen scale is a fun way to build metric system abilities and apply measurement techniques. This recipe series is ideal for both new and experienced chefs. Completing a NIST metric recipe is an opportunity to apply culinary math, develop measurement skills, interpret instructions, complete steps in a necessary sequence, troubleshoot, build self-confidence, and enjoy the delicious results. Cooking and baking activities develop fine motor skills and coordination, practice selecting appropriate cooking tools, opening containers, mixing, pouring without spilling, counting, weighing, as well as reading and interpreting a digital scale readout or oven thermometer. This printable recipe card series is best when printed on cardstock. Companion resources are available on the NIST Metric Cooking website.</abstract>
