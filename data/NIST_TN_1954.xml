    <abstract>We describe measurements to create a library of high-fidelity waveforms of federal incumbent radar signals currently operating in the 3550 MHz - 3650 MHz (3.5 GHz) band. In the first phase of assembling this library, measurements were collected at Point Loma continuously over a two- month period. The measurements consist of 60-second power spectral measurements collected every 10 minutes as well as high-resolution in-phase and quadrature sampled waveforms covering the entire band in question and portions of adjacent bands. The spectral measurements were used to characterize normal and anomalous behaviors. A subset of the high-resolution I/Q waveforms containing no adjacent-band or other in-band emissions was selected for statistical analysis of key parameters of the target radar that could aid detection, namely, the antenna rotation period, pulse repetition interval, pulse duration, and center frequency. The subset of approximately 800 acquisitions of in-band radar consisted of about 12 000 sweeps of the main beam and nearly 223 000 individual pulses ranging in peak power by over 40 dB. Distributions of the parameters are reported along with percentiles.</abstract>
