    <abstract>The directory is a guide to laboratory accreditation and similar types of programs conducted by state and local government agencies. These programs accredit or designate laboratories or other entities to conduct testing to assist the agencies in carrying out their responsibilities. The accreditation or designation is based on some type of assessment regarding the capability of the laboratory to conduct the testing. However, the nature of such assessments varies considerably from agency to agency. Entries in the directory are based primarily on information provided by each state and local government agency and reflect the agency's view of its activities.</abstract>
