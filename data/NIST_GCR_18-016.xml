    <abstract>This report is a supplement to the paper published as Transient Thermal Response of an Extended Temperature Range 500-mm diameter Guarded Hot-plate Apparatus by Thomas and Zarr (2018), hereafter referred to as the paper. The paper emphasizes the use of a mathematical model based on interconnected aggregated-capacity subcomponents to determine controller settings for power supplied to various embedded heating elements. This report contains additional detailed information on aspects of the model that is specific to using LabVIEW software for simulation computations adapted to this guarded hot-plate apparatus. The report refers to equations and figures by their numbers as listed in the paper. Equations specific to this report are labeled with letters to distinguish from references to items in the paper. The purpose of the report is to assist users in correcting, modifying, or extending the mathematical model by providing additional details to facilitate reading the software. Specifically, the report includes heat transfer relationships used, component properties such as mass, and methods for evaluating thermal conductances along with typical values.</abstract>
