    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the eleventh installment of the Model-Based Enterprise Summit (MBE 2020) on March 31 through April 2, 2020 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The MBE 2020 witnessed another year-over-year registration and attendance growth. The MBE Summit saw hundreds of attendees gather over three days to share their experiences with Model-Based Enterprise (MBE). This speaks to the continued growing interest of MBE within the community and the importance of the Summit output. The goal of the MBE Summit is to identify challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in design, manufacturing, quality assurance, and sustainment of products and processes where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in a product's lifecycle. The theme of MBE 2020 was Increasing MBE Adoption and Implementation. There is no doubt that MBE requires a complex organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people, skills, and technology in workplaces. The 11th MBE Summit is focused on highlighting the organizational culture surrounding MBE, needs of people operating in MBE, and real-world implementations of MBE in practice. Authors from academia, government, and industry submitted papers on topics related to this year's theme using the following tracks: 1) Business Processes; 2) Organization Culture; 3) Technology; and 4) Workforce Skills. This volume contains the papers presented at MBE 2020. The MBE 2020 program included four invited talks, five tutorials, five panels, and 25 papers. In addition, the MBE 2020 program included a vendor-demonstration track where solution providers and vendors demonstrated MBE offerings.</abstract>
