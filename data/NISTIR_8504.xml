    <abstract>NoSQL database systems and data stores often outperform traditional RDBMS in various aspects, such as data analysis efficiency, system performance, ease of deployment, flexibility/scalability of data management, and usersâ€™ availability. However, with an increasing number of people storing sensitive data in NoSQL databases, security issues have become critical concerns. NoSQL databases suffer from vulnerabilities, particularly due to the lack of effective support for data protection, including weak authorization mechanisms. As access control is a fundamental data protection requirement of any database management system DBMS, this document focuses on access control on NoSQL database systems.</abstract>
