    <abstract>This report presents descriptive statistics characterizing a set of over 14,000 spectrograms covering the 3.5 GHz band that were recorded by a recent measurement campaign at two coastal locations: Point Loma, in San Diego, California and Fort Story, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Specifically, occupancy and vacancy statistics are compiled for each frequency where a primary federal incumbent system in the 3.5 GHz band, the shipborne SPN-43 air traffic control radar, was observed. In addition, empirical ambient (SPN-43 absent) power density distributions are presented for each multiple of 10 MHz between 3430-3680 MHz. These descriptive statistics are potentially informative to federal regulators and potential commercial users of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) that permits commercial wireless networks to share spectrum with federal users in the 3550-3700 MHz band in the United States.</abstract>
