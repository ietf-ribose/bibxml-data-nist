    <abstract>Nondestructive test (NDT) methods and sensor technologies are evaluated in the context of providing input parameters to service life prediction models for reinforced concrete structures. Relevant NDT methods and sensors are identified that are based on diverse technologies including mechanical impact, ultrasonic waves, electromagnetic waves, nuclear, and chemical and electrical methods. The degradation scenarios of reinforcement corrosion, alkali-silica reaction, and cracking are used to identify gaps in available NDT methods for supporting condition assessment and service life prediction. Common gaps are identified, along with strategies for resolving those gaps.</abstract>
