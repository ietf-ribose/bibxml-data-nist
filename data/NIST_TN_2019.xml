    <abstract>Phase I of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Transactive Energy (TE) Modeling and Simulation Challenge for the Smart Grid spanned September 2015 to September 2016. The TE Challenge was initiated to identify existing simulation tools and expertise that might be developed or combined in co-simulation platforms to enable the evaluation of transactive energy approaches. Seven teams composed of multiple organizations participated in the TE Challenge. This report introduces the teams and summarizes accomplishments from the TE Challenge, which include: definition of TE scenarios and reference grid components; development of a common platform component model for co-simulation; analysis of the TE regulatory environment; analysis of common transactive services; and development of a reference architecture for TE in a microgrid environment.</abstract>
