    <abstract>This handbook compiles the latest Uniform Laws and Regulations and related interpretations and guidelines adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures, Inc. (NCWM). At the 1983 Annual Meeting, the NCWM voted to change the title of Handbook 130 and the title of the Laws and Regulations compiled in this handbook. The former title of the handbook was 'Model State Laws and Regulations.' 'Model State' was to be changed to 'Uniform' in the title to reflect that these Laws and Regulations are (a) intended to be standards rather than just guidelines, and (b) intended for adoption by political subdivisions other than states when deemed appropriate. This edition includes amendments approved at the 104th NCWM Annual Meetings in 2019. The NCWM recommends adoption and promulgation by weights and measures jurisdictions of these Uniform Laws and Regulations as updated in this handbook. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the statutory responsibility to promote 'cooperate with the states in securing uniformity in weights and measures laws and methods of inspection.'' In partial fulfillment of this responsibility, the Institute is pleased to publish these recommendations of the NCWM. This handbook promotes the primary use of the International System of Units (SI) by citing SI units before U.S. customary units where both units appear together, and by placing separate sections containing requirements for SI units before corresponding sections containing requirements for customary units. In some cases, however, trade practice is currently restricted to the use of customary units; therefore, some requirements in this handbook will continue to specify only customary units until the NCWM achieves a broad consensus on the permitted metric units.</abstract>
