    <abstract>Fractography is a powerful tool for the analysis of fractured glasses and ceramics. It is applicable to fractures created under controlled conditions in the laboratory and to component failures in service. Fractography can identify the cause of failure and can even provide quantitative information about the loading conditions. The goal of this Guide is to make fractographic analysis of brittle materials less an art and more an engineering practice for scientists and engineers. This guide emphasizes practical approaches for problem solving and failure analyses.</abstract>
