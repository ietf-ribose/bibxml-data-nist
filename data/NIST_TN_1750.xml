    <abstract>In 2006, researchers from 22 organizations in ten countries began a joint effort to enable the cost-effective commissioning of existing and future buildings to improve the buildings' operating performance. The commissioning techniques developed through this Annex are intended to help transition the industry from the intuitive approach, currently employed in the operation of buildings, to more systematic operation focusing on achieving significant energy savings. Key outputs of IEA - ECBCS Annex 47 include: - Methods and tools for commissioning advanced systems and low energy buildings; - Methods and tools for field application; - Information on the costs and benefits that can be used to promote the wider use of commissioning. This report presents an extended summary of the research results.</abstract>
