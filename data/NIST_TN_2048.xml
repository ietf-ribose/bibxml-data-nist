    <abstract>This report was written by staff of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC, the Commission) under an interagency agreement in support of the Commission's effort to address the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning hazard associated with consumer use of portable generators. This report presents a plan for a computer simulation study to support CPSC staff's evaluation of the effectiveness of CO mitigation requirements that were adopted in two voluntary standards in 2018. These two standards are ANSI/PGMA G300-2018, Safety and Performance of Portable Generators (referred to as PGMA G300) and ANSI/UL 2201-2018, Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emission Rate of Portable Generators (referred to as UL 2201). Both voluntary standards have requirements for a system that will shut the generator off when specific CO concentrations are present near the generator. PGMA G300 also has notification requirements to alert the user of the presence of CO after the generator has shut off, while UL 2201 has a reduced CO emission rate requirement. To support CPSC staff's evaluation of the effectiveness of these requirements in addressing the CO hazard, this report documents the plan for conducting a computer simulation study and for analyzing the output of that study. The methodology is largely similar to that used by CPSC staff to evaluate the benefits of the proposed rule issued by the Commission in 2016. This simulation study will use the same forty buildings, weather conditions, and generator characteristics to study the rate at which the CO emitted from the generator accumulates in, transports within, and leaves the homes and detached garages for generators with and without CO safety shutoff systems. The plan includes over 900 scenarios that will be considered in all the buildings, which will require more than a million simulations and subsequent analysis of the simulation outputs.</abstract>
