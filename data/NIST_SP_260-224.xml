    <abstract>Standard Reference Material (SRM) 3655 is intended primarily for use as a calibration standard for the measurement of enzymatically released N-linked glycans. Applications of SRM 3655 include the benchmarking and comparability of analytical techniques, as a material for ensuring system suitability, and for analytical method validation. This material may also be used to value-assign in-house calibrators or control materials. SRM 3655 consists of thirteen (13) aqueous solutions of glycans commonly associated with monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Each solution contains a purified, free-reducing glycan at a defined mass fraction. A unit of SRM 3655 consists of thirteen 0.5 mL vials each containing approximately 0.2 mL of solution, frozen and stored at -80 C. The tube is labeled and is sealed with a color-coded screw cap with a Teflon liner. This publication documents the production, analytical methods, measurement results, and statistical evaluations involved in characterizing these glycan materials.</abstract>
