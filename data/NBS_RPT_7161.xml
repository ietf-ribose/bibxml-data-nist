    <abstract>Type FNH-25-12B resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation, were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The factors investigated included (1) gage factor at about 75¿̐¿ F, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing temperature, (3) response when subjected to large strains, (4) change of resistance with time at various constant temperatures, (5) change of resistance with temperature, (6) response when subjected to high heating rates, and (7) resistance between the gage and the base material. The results of these tests indicate that the gage factor at 75¿̐¿ F is within the manufacturer's stated range; that the gage factor at 1000¿̐¿ F is about 90 percent of the room temperature value; that the gages are able to sustain strains of 0.004 at 75¿̐¿ F and of 0o002 at 600¿̐¿ F; that the temperature coefficient of resistance of the gages installed on type 302 stainless steel is high, positive, and nearly constant between 75¿̐¿ and 800¿̐¿ F but changes rapidly and becomes very high between 800¿̐¿ and 1200¿̐¿ F; and that the gage response is repeatable under a given transient heating condition.</abstract>
