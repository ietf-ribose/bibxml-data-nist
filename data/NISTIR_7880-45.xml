    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat- and water-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Winter 2015 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXVII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin 42 Total Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum. The materials for both studies were shipped to participants in January 2015. To help reduce overhead costs and avoid raising participation fees, the materials for Round Robin LXXVIII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and Round Robin 43 Total Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum were also shipped in the same shipping container. Participants in Round Robins LXXVII and 42 were requested to provide measurement results by May 18, 2015.</abstract>
