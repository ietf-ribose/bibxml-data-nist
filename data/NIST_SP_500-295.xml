    <abstract>Conformance testing measures whether an implementation faithfully implements the technical requirements defined in a standard. Conformance testing provides developers, users, and purchasers with increased levels of confidence in product quality and increases the probability of successful interoperability. The Information Technology Laboratory of NIST (NIST/ITL) sponsored the development of a conformance testing methodology for ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial  Other Biometric Information(AN-2011) under the NIST/ITL Conformance Testing Methodology Working Group. This testing methodology supports the development of conformance test tools designed to test implementations of AN-2011 transactions and promotes biometrics conformity assessment efforts. The first release includes comprehensive tables of AN-2011 requirements and test assertions for a set of supported AN-2011 Record Types. The tables of requirements and assertions indicate which assertions apply to the traditional encoding format, the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)-compliant encoding format, or both encoding formats. The testing methodology makes use of specific test assertion syntax to clearly define the assertions associated with each requirement.</abstract>
