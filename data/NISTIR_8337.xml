    <abstract>This user guide describes an integrated set of C++ software tools for manipulating XML (eXtensible Markup Language) schemas and XML instance files. The tools are: - xmlSchemaParser - parses and reformats XML schema files, prints type derivation hierarchies - xmlInstanceParserGenerator - generates C++ classes and a YACC/Lex instance file parser from an XML schema - it's a software tool that writes software tools - orphanFinder - identifies unused types and undefined types in one to many XML schema files - xmlSchemaAttributeConverter - rewrites an XML schema file, converting attributes to elements All of the tools are invoked by giving a command in a terminal window. The tools were built at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The xmlSchemaParser and the xmlInstanceParserGenerator were originally built in support of the Agility Performance of Robotic Systems project. They have been greatly extended since that time. The orphanFinder and xmlSchemaAttributeConverter are more recent.</abstract>
