    <abstract>The FY 2019 summary, prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), compiles the reports provided by 22 participating agencies listed in Appendix A. In these reports, agencies document any new use of GUS in lieu of VCS during FY 2019 and provide a rationale for each new use. Agencies also list any rescinded GUS in lieu of VCS during the past year. Agencies briefly describe their activities undertaken to carry out provisions described in Circular A-119.</abstract>
