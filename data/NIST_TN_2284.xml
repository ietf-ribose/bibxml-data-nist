    <abstract>the report outlines preliminary studies undertaken to assess the thermal and cold neutron beam performance of a pre-conceptual design of the NNS. The results demonstrate the possibility and feasibility for significant performance enhancements of the NNS for a similar scale reactor core that builds on experience with the NBSR design. Further improvements and optimizations will be explored later as the NNS design evolves.</abstract>
