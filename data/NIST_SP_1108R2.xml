    <abstract>The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 requires that NIST develop a framework of standards for the Smart Grid. This document is the second release of the framework first published in January, 2010. It covers the activities and outputs of the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel(SGIP), which is a public-private partnership to support development of this NIST framework. It includes progress on and plans for further development of the Conceptual Architectural Framework; an update to the list of standards identified by NIST and the SGIP for the Smart Grid; a description of the SGIP organization, its activities, processes, and working groups, including the Priority Action Plans for addressing Smart Grid standards gaps and overlaps; cybersecurity strategy and plans for and work products of the SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG); development of a framework for interoperability testing and certification, including the Interoperability Process Reference Manual (IPRM); and a discussion of the next steps in the development of the NIST interoperability framework.</abstract>
