    <abstract>This report presents a design for a novel test apparatus to directly measure the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). The design of the apparatus was focused primarily on being able to measure the MCE with minimized uncertainties for test samples of 5 g. The effort is meant to aid U.S. industry in selecting new, limited-quantity magnetocaloric (MC) materials for commercial development. A different measurement approach is also required because of the small test sample size and because of the wide disagreement in the validity of some indirect measurement techniques. These concerns require an accurate and direct measure of MCE in order to develop superior room temperature magnetocaloric materials. For the test apparatus design presented here, the estimated uncertainties for the adiabatic temperature change and the increased internal energy are 0.3 K and 0.6 % of the measurement, respectively. The small uncertainties were achieved for the small sample by leveraging the incompressibility of liquid as an amplifier to increase the sensitivity of energy measurement. Drawings, parts list, and required test equipment were specified for the construction of the test apparatus. A calibration technique using a first law of thermodynamics approach was outlined.</abstract>
