    <abstract>A wide variability in accuracy exists among commercial radiation detection instruments used to measure exposure rate or ambient dose equivalent rate. These instruments are used to measure both the radiation background and the radiation field produced by radioactive sources that are used to test other types of radiation detection systems against different consensus document standards. These instruments are used as reference instruments. This document provides information and recommendations on how to characterize ionization chambers including high pressure ionization chambers (HPIC) and unsealed standard ionization chambers.</abstract>
