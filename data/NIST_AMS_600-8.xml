  <abstract format="text/plain" script="Latn">The Manufacturing USA Program’s 2019 reauthorization allows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to renew Manufacturing USA institute support, subject to a “rigorous merit review.” Following an initial five to seven-year cooperative agreement in which federal support must be cost-matched by at least a 1:1 match of non-federal co-investment over the performance period of the award, NIST-funded institutes are now eligible to apply for renewal of their support. This document describes the institute renewal process, with a focus on the performance standards for the merit review.</abstract>
