    <abstract>Wireless connections are becoming popular in industrial environments that increasingly carry sensing and actuation data over the air. In industrial plants, activities of legacy wireless systems have shaped the channel usage in the radio spectrum bands for new wireless applications. The 2 GHz spectrum band consists of a good number of radio resources that are dedicated to fixed and mobile wireless communications. In this report, passive measurement data collected in two industrial plants is analyzed to identify existing wireless activities in this frequency band. Besides, a statistical channel usage model is developed for the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. The secondary spectrum utility is evaluated given legacy wireless activity in the ISM band, which is of particular interest to unlicensed industrial wireless networking standards, such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a.</abstract>
