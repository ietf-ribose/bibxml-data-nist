    <abstract>Biofabricated tissue-engineered constructs have the potential to transform personalized medicine. However, characterizing these constructs post-fabrication and throughout preclinical use remains challenging. On December 1, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a one-day, virtual workshop on measurement needs for biofabricated constructs that contain cells. The workshop focused on metrology for the structure of the constructs, cell viability in the constructs, and functional capacity of the constructs, with the aim of enabling future research directions, standards development, and the adoption of these constructs for clinical use.</abstract>
