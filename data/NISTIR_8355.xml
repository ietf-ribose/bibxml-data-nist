    <abstract>This publication from NICE describes Competency Areas as included in the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework), NIST Special Publication 800-181, Revision 1. The NICE Framework is a fundamental reference for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work. At its core are Task, Knowledge, and Skill (TKS) statements that provide a foundation for learners, including students, job seekers, and employees. These statements are then used to define Competency Areas—clusters of related Knowledge and Skill statements that correlates with one’s capability to perform Tasks in a particular domain—and Work Roles, which are composed of Task statements that constitute work for which someone is responsible or accountable. This document shares more detail about what NICE Framework Competency Areas are, including their evolution and development, clarifies the differences between Competency Areas and Work Roles, and provides example uses for Competency Areas from various stakeholder perspectives, and. Finally, the publication identifies where the NICE Framework list of Competency Areas is separately published and maintained distinct from this publication so it can be updated more frequently as a flexible and contemporary reference resource.</abstract>
