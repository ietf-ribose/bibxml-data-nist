    <abstract>The Association of Public-Safety Communications (APCO), in cooperation with FirstNet and the Department of Commerce held a half-day workshop on June 2, 2015 titled Identifying and Categorizing Data Types for Public Safety Mobile Applications. The goal of this workshop was to begin identifying different types of data that will flow through applications that operate on the National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). A diverse group of first responders, industry leaders, and government representatives attended the workshop. This document describes the workshop and captures the input received from the workshop attendees.</abstract>
