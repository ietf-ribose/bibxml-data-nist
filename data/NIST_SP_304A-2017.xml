    <abstract>This publication is a colorful chart explaining the 7 base units of the SI (International System of Units) and prefix symbols, featuring the Measurement League: Guardians of the SI. The Measurement League are superheroes dedicated to the fight against uncertainty, imprecision, and inaccuracy and to improving the quality of our lives and the things we build. The League of SI Superheroes was designed to encourage students to learn about metric measurements as they consider science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. SI familiarity and fluency must be developed along the STEM career pipeline to prepare the future workers with essential measurement skills.</abstract>
