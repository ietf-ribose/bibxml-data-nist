    <abstract>The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides organizations with assessment procedures and a methodology that can be used to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as independent, third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes.</abstract>
