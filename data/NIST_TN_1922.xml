    <abstract>Executive Order 13717 signed by President Obama on 2-2-2016 required NIST to draft Implementation Guidelines for Federal agencies to implement the requirements of the EO. This document provides suggested approaches for agencies to address the EO requirements - the document is advisory only. The Guidelines have been extensively reviewed by NIST technical staff, NIST Counsel, the Federal agencies represented on the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), the National Security Council technical staff and Council's office. A formal Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (CISR) review was conducted in November.</abstract>
