    <abstract>The object of this study is to investigate over-water tropospheric propagation characteristics for both within and beyond line-of-sight paths. Information on the reliability of propagation and on variations in the velocity of propagation will be obtained for various tropospheric conditions. These measurements will supplement the measurements obtained in the Cheyenne Mountain experiment and will have particular application to ground-to-ground propagation in the Pacific coast region.</abstract>
