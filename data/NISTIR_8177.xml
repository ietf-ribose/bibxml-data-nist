    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed to measure the performance impact of cybersecurity defenses on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The testbed allows researchers to emulate real-world industrial manufacturing processes and their control systems without replicating an entire factory environment or its machinery. This report focuses on the Robotic Enclave of the testbed, which is comprised of two robotic arms that emulate a material handling application where parts are transported collaboratively through simulated sequential machining operations. Metrics, key performance indicators, and methodologies for the performance measurements on the manufacturing process and specific subsystems are described.</abstract>
