    <abstract>Public safety practitioners performing day-to-day activities and responding to incidents communicate in ways that are very different from the general public. In order to determine if a particular technology or network deployment can meet the performance requirements critical to first responders, sound and detailed scenarios are needed. In this document, we present a fictional school shooting scenario involving a large number of responders, vehicles, and applications, over a 4-hour period. We describe, in detail, the location of the users, the type of applications used and their usage patterns. We also present a basic net-work deployment using Long Term Evolution (LTE) and describe the implementation of such a scenario in the open-source ns-3 simulation platform so it can serve as a baseline for future research.</abstract>
