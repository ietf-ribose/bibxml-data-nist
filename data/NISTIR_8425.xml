    <abstract>This publication documents the consumer profile of NIST's Internet of Things (IoT) core baseline and identifies cybersecurity capabilities commonly needed for the consumer IoT sector (i.e., IoT products for home or personal use). It can also be a starting point for businesses to consider in the purchase of IoT products. The consumer profile was developed as part of NIST's response to Executive Order 14028 and was initially published in Recommended Criteria for Cybersecurity Labeling for Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) Products. The consumer profile capabilities are phrased as cybersecurity outcomes that are intended to apply to the entire IoT product. This document also discusses the foundations for developing the recommended consumer profile and related considerations. NIST reviewed a landscape of relevant source documents to inform the consumer profile and engaged with stakeholders across a year-long effort to develop the recommendations.</abstract>
