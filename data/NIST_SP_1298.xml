    <abstract>This report describes the development of standards for radioactivity and x rays in the US during the first two decades of the 20th century. The first standards for radium were pioneered by chemists in industry and academia. The US national standards were established at the National Institute of Standards and Technology on receipt of a radium standard from Marie Curie and the International Radium Standards Commission in 1913. During World War I, the NIST began development of standards for self-luminescent dials and watches containing radium paint, and standards for x-rays to support the US industry for protective materials against x rays and radium. Marie Curieâ€™s 1921 visit to the NIST to receive a gram of radium funded by donations from the women of America is described.</abstract>
