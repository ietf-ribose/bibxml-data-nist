    <abstract>The special publication contains complete papers on the subjects presented at the seminar, providing more of the technical details. For the sessions on Precisioin Waveform Synthesis, Precision Waveform Sampling, and Data Converter Characterization, six formal papers are given describing the hardware and software techniques used for developing NBS laboratory standards and apparatus for testing ac sources and voltmeters, phase angle meters, transient waveform recorders, wideband wattmeters, and digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters. For the informal session on Instrumentation Metrology, three subsequent papers have been written for publication which are included for completeness in the Appendices.</abstract>
