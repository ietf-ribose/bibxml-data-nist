    <abstract>Each year the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) provides a report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) summarizing federal agency use of government unique standards (GUS) used in lieu of voluntary consensus standards (VCS) during the previous fiscal year (FY) as required by Section 12(d)(3) of Public Law 104-113, the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA). The FY 2016 summary, prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, compiles the reports provided by 25 participating agencies listed in Appendix A. In these reports, agencies document any new use of GUS in lieu of VCS during FY 2016 and provide a rationale for each new use. Agencies briefly described their activities undertaken to carry out provisions described in OMB Circular A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and Conformity Assessment Activities. Individual agency reports may be found at https://standards.gov/NTTAA/agency/index.cfm? fuseaction=agencyReports.main.</abstract>
