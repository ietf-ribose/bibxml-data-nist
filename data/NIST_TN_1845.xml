    <abstract>This Technical Note develops a method for identifying residential fire incidents, reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), with missing information regarding the item first ignited (IFI) or item most contributing to flame spread (IMCFS) that were likely to have involved upholstered furniture. Using NFIRS data, upholstered furniture involvement can only be identified using the IFI or IMCFS fields; however, it is not uncommon for these fields to contain missing values or to be coded as unknown (undetermined). Current statistical methods address this issue by allocating the missing and unknown incidents proportionally over the distribution of those known. The appropriateness of this depends on the representativeness of the known incidents. This Technical Note explores a data imputation method to determine the likelihood of upholstered furniture involvement based on statistical correlations with other factors describing the fire incident. A number of competing statistical models are evaluated using the data imputation approach, with the best performing models selected based on the minimum out-of-sample root mean squared prediction error. The optimum models based on this criterion are then used to estimate the number of U.S. residential upholstered furniture fires, related occupant fatalities, injuries, and property and content losses, and the results are compared to the conventional scaling-based techniques currently used by the National Fire Protection Association</abstract>
