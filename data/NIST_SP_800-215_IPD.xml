    <abstract>Access to multiple cloud services, the geographic spread of enterprise IT resources (including multiple data centers), and the emergence of microservices-based applications (as opposed to monolithic ones) have significantly altered the enterprise network landscape. This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a secure operations perspective. Hence, it starts by examining the security limitations of the current network access solutions to the enterprise network. It then considers security feature enhancements to traditional network appliances in the form of point security solutions, network configurations for various security functions (e.g., application security, cloud access security, device or endpoint security, etc.), security frameworks that integrate these individual network configurations, and the evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure to provide a comprehensive set of security services
                     for the modern enterprise network landscape.</abstract>
