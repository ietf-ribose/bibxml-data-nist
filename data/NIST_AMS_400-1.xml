    <abstract>Thorough and unambiguous definitions of a broad set of on-machine measurement use cases and information are offered. Relevant in-situ and off-machine measurement use cases are also described in some detail, due to their close relationship to on-machine measurement. The use cases are defined to expose a comprehensive scope of information useful to manufacturing information standards bodies. Activity diagrams for on-machine measurement are presented which help clarify the use cases and information elements required for on-machine measurement. Due to the lack of definitional consensus on terms and definitions for on-machine measurement in the literature, a broad scope of terms required by the numerous and varied types of quality measurement use cases commonly performed on or around machine tools are precisely defined, while seeking to remain faithful to definitional usage common in industry and academia.</abstract>
