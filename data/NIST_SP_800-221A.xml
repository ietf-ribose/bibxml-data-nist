    <abstract>The increasing frequency, creativity, and severity of technology attacks means that all enterprises should ensure that information and communications technology (ICT) risk is receiving appropriate attention within their enterprise risk management (ERM) programs. Specific types of ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, privacy, and supply chain. This document provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of ICT risk. It complements NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of Information  Communications Technology Risk, which focuses on the use of risk registers to communicate and manage ICT risk.</abstract>
