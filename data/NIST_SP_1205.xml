    <abstract>The recent release of Building Industry Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) v3.0 incorporated the energy, environmental, and cost measurements for 240 000 residential building designs for a 2-story colonial house based on the NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) located in Gaithersburg, MD for study period lengths ranging from 1 year to 40 years. Focusing on a single location allows for consideration of incremental building energy efficiency improvements instead of the suite of energy efficiency requirements specified in the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) as was the focus of the residential database incorporated in BIRDS v2.0. Building design specifications included in the database span the five most recent IECC editions through net-zero energy performance. Additional options not included in previous versions of BIRDS are input alternatives for discount rate, home loan financing, and construction quality for a total of 8 cases. The 240 000 designs across 8 cases (sets of assumptions) and 40 study periods allows for comparisons across over 75 million records to determine the effects of improving building energy efficiency on the overall sustainability performance. The purpose of this study is to utilize similar methodology as that used in prior analysis of BIRDS databases to analyze the BIRDS low-energy residential database. Our analysis will entail making comparisons between a Maryland residential code-compliant design (based on 2015 IECC), serving as our baseline, and a series of alternative designs with varying levels of energy efficiency based on energy, economic, and environmental performance. Findings from this study will shed light on the effects of incremental improvements in residential building energy efficiency, as well as the effects of varying the investor s time horizon and other assumptions, on overall sustainability performance in terms of energy efficiency, life-cycle assessment score coupled with life-cycle cost considerations.</abstract>
