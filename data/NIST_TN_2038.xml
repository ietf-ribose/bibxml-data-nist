    <abstract>This report presents experimental investigations of the performance of cold-formed steel lateral force-resisting systems (CFS-LRFS) under combinations of simulated earthquake and fire loading. Three types of shear wall systems are investigated: gypsum-sheet steel composite panel sheathed walls, oriented strand board (OSB) sheathed walls, and steel strap braced walls. Twenty-two 2.7 m tall by 3.7 m long test specimens are subjected sequentially to combinations of mechanical (cyclic shear deformation) and thermal (fire) load. The mechanical loading setup and protocol are based on ASTM E2126 Method C (CUREE Basic Loading Protocol). Fire loads of varying intensity that represent the characteristics of actual fires are investigated. The work is a step toward developing fragility curves (representations of the probability of exceeding a given damage state as a function of an engineering demand parameter) for these systems and is essential for performance-based design for fire.</abstract>
