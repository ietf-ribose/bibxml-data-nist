    <abstract>Verified and validated test methods, being necessary to measure the performance of complex systems, are important tools for driving innovation, benchmarking and improving performance, and establishing trust in collaborative human-robot teams. This full-day workshop aims to explore the metrology necessary for repeatably and independently assessing the collaborative performance of robotic systems in real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. This workshop aims to bridge the gaps between the theory and applications of HRI in industry, accelerating the adoption of cutting edge technologies as the industry state-of-practice. The interest in collaborative HRI is evident in the current market as well as standards efforts toward manufacturing, social, medical, and service robot solutions. Though these domains have been considered separate for many years, recent technological and scientific advancements show that, while their applications may differ, the underlying principles of HRI performance impact each identically. As such, this workshop seeks to identify test methods and metrics for the holistic assessment and assurance of collaborative HRI performance. The focus is on identifying the key performance indicators of these seemingly disparate sectors, and additionally to establish a community based on the principles of transparency, repeatability,  establishing trust in the assessment of collaborative HRI. The goal is to aid in the advancement of HRI technologies through the development of experimental scenarios, protocols, test methods,  metrics for the verification and validation of interaction solutions and interface designs.</abstract>
