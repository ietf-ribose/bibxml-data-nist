    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (NIST SP 1190) in October 2015. The Guide describes a six-step process to develop a community resilience plan. The Guide was intended to be flexible, so that it could be used to create a standalone plan or to complement other planning processes by integrating resilience measures into long-term plans. Since the Guide?s release, several communities have begun to use the Guide to develop resilience plans. This report documents three of those early applications. The three applications, Fort Collins, Colorado, Delaware Department of Transportation, and Howard County, MD, offer three different approaches to the use of the Guide and demonstrate its flexibility.</abstract>
