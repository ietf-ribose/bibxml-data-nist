    <abstract>Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked, digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. While opportunities exist with Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional technical approaches and the growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important fundamental concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework series of volumes. This volume, Volume 3, contains the original 51 Version 1 use cases gathered by the NBD-PWG Use Cases and Requirements Subgroup and the requirements generated from those use cases. The use cases are presented in their original and summarized form. Requirements, or challenges, were extracted from each use case, and then summarized over all the use cases. These generalized requirements were used in the development of the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA), which is presented in Volume 6. Currently, the subgroup is accepting additional use case submissions using the more detailed Use Case Template 2. The Use Case Template 2 and the two Version 2 use cases collected to date are presented and summarized in this volume.</abstract>
