    <abstract>This NIST Special Publication provides guidance for federal procurement initiators, contracting officers, and computer security officials on including computer security in acquisitions. To accomplish this goal, computer security and federal information processing (FIP) procurement must be integrated. Computer security is the protection of the integrity, availability and confidentiality of automated information and the resources used to enter, store, process, and communicate the information. Computer security shares properties with systems/software engineering including trustworthiness, system safety, and reliability. FIP procurement is the process of acquiring hardware, software, firmware, computer-related services and telecommunications. FIP procurement begins with the process of determining needs and ends with contract completion.</abstract>
