    <abstract>The ASTM E2919-22 standard provides a test method for evaluating 3D scanners for static pose. This standard was developed in conjunction with the industry and NIST led this effort and published the standard in initially in 2014. This standard was revised and the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST led this effort. This report introduces methods to calculate orientation error and uncertainty from 3D point cloud data of physical artifacts.</abstract>
