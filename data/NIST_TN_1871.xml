    <abstract>A workshop was held at NIST Gaithersburg on October 27 and 28, 2014 to discuss the exothermic reaction of halogenated hydrocarbons. The industries that gathered to discuss the topic were the fire suppression, fire suppression in aircraft, and Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration industries. In the former, the compounds of interest are used as fire suppressants, and in the latter, as working fluids for vapor compression heating/cooling equipment. The purpose of the workshop was to identify the important parameters controlling the flammability of the compounds, and identify research needs for overcoming the obstacles to their safe and effective use.</abstract>
