    <abstract>NIST Handbook 130 includes a compilation of model laws and regulations and related interpretations and guidelines designed to encourage uniformity in adoption and implementation of weights and measures laws and regulations. The model laws and regulations included in NIST Handbook 130 are adopted in various forms by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures authorities. Some authorities adopt the current versions as written; some use them as the basis of adoption, but from an earlier year; some use them as a guideline only; some elect to use their own laws or regulations; and some have no corresponding law or regulation in place. This 2024 edition includes amendments made through the Committee on Laws and Regulations of the NCWM with technical guidance from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and input from weights and measures officials and industry representatives. These amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 108th Annual Meeting in July 2023.</abstract>
