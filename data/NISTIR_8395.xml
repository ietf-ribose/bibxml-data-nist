    <abstract>This project addresses the objectives of the Statement of Need number WPSON-17-20 No/Low Global Warming Potential Alternatives to Ozone Depleting Refrigerants. Its goal is to identify and demonstrate performance of low global-warming-potential (GWP), non-flammable refrigerants to replace HFC-134a in military environmental control units (ECUs). This project is a follow-on to the limited-scope project WP-2740, which used thermodynamic cycle simulation models alone to screen over 100 000 refrigerant blends and identified over 20 candidate HFC-134a replacements. In this study we narrow the pool of blend candidates down to three best fluids, verify experimentally their flammability behavior, demonstrate their performance through tests in a military ECU in environmental chambers at a wide range of operating conditions, and extrapolate the laboratory measured performance to ECUs equipped with optimized heat exchangers through first-principles-based simulations combined with machine-learning optimization methods. This Interim Report documents the preliminary work leading to the selection of three best blends. This work included refrigerant blend tests in a laboratory mini-breadboard heat pump apparatus, fundamental measurements and modeling of thermophysical properties, two-phase heat-transfer performance, and flammability behavior.</abstract>
