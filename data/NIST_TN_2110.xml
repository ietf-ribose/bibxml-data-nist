    <abstract>HVACSIM+ (HVAC SIMulation PLUS other systems) was introduced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1985 as a computer simulation tool to simulate building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The HVACSIM+ computer program package and manuals have been distributed to hundreds of researchers, students, and consultants in countries around the world 1. HVACSIM+ input files are configured through a text-based interface, as was common for programs developed in that era. Reviewing the configuration files defining a model in a text editor is a tedious, difficult and error-prone process for a large simulation. The HVACSIM+ Configuration Tool provides a method to visualize the complicated connections between components in a HVACSIM+ model and assist with validation and modifications to those models. This user s guide assumes a working knowledge of HVACSIM+ .</abstract>
