    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (NIST SP 1190) in October 2015. The Guide describes a six-step process to develop a community resilience plan. The Guide was intended to be flexible, so that it could be used to create a standalone plan or to complement other planning processes by integrating resilience measures into longterm community plans. Since the Guide's release, communities have begun to use it to develop resilience plans. This report documents uses data from implementation evaluation surveys and direct interaction with communities using the Guide to understand how it is being implemented and how resilience planning is being integrated with other existing planning processes. The report also documents practices that can be replicated in other locations and identifies gaps where additional guidance or tools would be helpful to facilitate resilience planning.</abstract>
