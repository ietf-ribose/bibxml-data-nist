    <abstract>In this special publication, we report on a modified synthetic process that results in a stable suspension of Au-PEI nanoparticles, Au-PEI@NIST. Synthesized materials were characterized using an orthogonal approach that included dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-Vis absorbance (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Very importantly, the end-product in this study demonstrated excellent colloidal stability in multiple aqueous environments including over a wide pH and temperature range of physiological relevance. The product also exhibited long-term storage stability under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of Au-PEI@NIST was investigated using the CHO K1 cell line and exhibited dose proportional toxicity, which suggested potential for use as a positive control in nanotoxicology studies. The results and stringent testing regimen point toward an effective and sustainable approach that can serve as a clarified starting point for the development of more complex conjugates for nanomedicine area.</abstract>
