    <abstract>Data exchange transactions for the engineering, procurement, and operation of process equipment depend heavily on product data sheets. Product data sheets are traditional paper forms that serve as the main method of communicating detailed equipment specifications. There are many standards for the layout and use of product data sheets, but there are still problems with the data exchanges that use them. First, most transactions are still done with the exchange of document images, e.g., scanned product data sheets, which have to be interpreted by humans and transcribed for use in a software tool. Second, the commonly used machine-interpretable forms of product data sheets are created using spreadsheet tools, but there is often disagreement on terminology and on the intended meaning of certain fields. This publication introduces the concept of a Product Data Sheet Ontology covering the types of information included on product data sheets. The ontology is a formal machine-readable terminology that is based on industry standard glossaries of terms and definitions. The paper specifically includes the concepts used in Centrifugal Pump, Pressure Transmitter, and Valve data sheets. The paper depicts the product data sheet concepts and their relationships in UML diagrams and describes them in detail in text. The UML models are used to generate computer-interpretable OWL ontologies. The text includes the relationships of the ontology elements to industry standards for product data sheet information.</abstract>
