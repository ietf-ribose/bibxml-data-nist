    <abstract>A data reduction tool was developed to conveniently post-process spherical constant volume flame experiments. Such experiments are employed to obtain laminar flame velocities in a premixed gas mixture. The setup is relatively simple and the only recorded physical quantities are pressure and time. Under various model assumption this so called pressure trace can be used to deduce the flame velocity. Many such models with different levels of complexity are available in the literature. One category of models are the shell models where the vessel content is divided in grid shells and the flame history is reconstructed employing physical models. Three of those shell models are implemented in the present tool. This technical note describes the installation and provides a user guide with additional details about the models and the algorithms. Its purpose is to help users efficiently use the tool and obtain physically meaningful results.</abstract>
