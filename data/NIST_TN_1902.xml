    <abstract>The goal of the work was to determine the flammability of R1234ze(E) (C3H2F4) per the Japanese High Pressure Gas Law (see Appendix I). Tests were also performed with R32 (CH2F2), R134a (C2H2F4) and methane (CH4), to provide a baseline for comparison of the results with R1234ze(E). Since the measured flammability of the mixture might be affected by the ignition source, tests were conducted with either copper wire (0.08 mm or 0.361 mm diameter), tungsten wire (0.3 mm diameter) or the standard platinum wire (0.3 mm diameter). To aid in the interpretation of the experiments, calculations were also performed for the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, the homogeneous autoignition time ?ign, the overall chemical rate from stirred-reactor simulations, and the laminar burning velocity. These latter simulations employed a detailed chemical kinetic model, and solved the conservation equations for mass, energy, and species conservation.</abstract>
