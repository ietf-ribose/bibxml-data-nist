    <abstract>This document provides federal agencies with a guide for implementing attributes in access control systems. Attributes enable a logical access control methodology where authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes. This document outlines factors which influence attributes that an authoritative body must address when standardizing an attribute system and proposes some notional implementation suggestions for consideration.</abstract>
