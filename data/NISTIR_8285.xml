    <abstract>HAMQAP was launched in collaboration with the NIH ODS in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements in samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human metabolism (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum of health assessment. Exercise 3 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in house measurements of nutritional elements (iodine and selenium), contaminants (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and furans), water-soluble vitamins (folates), fat-soluble vitamins (carotenoids), natural product compounds (ubiquinone), and botanicals (isoflavones) in foods and dietary supplements, and corresponding biomarkers/metabolites in clinical specimens (including human milk, serum, blood, plasma, and urine).</abstract>
