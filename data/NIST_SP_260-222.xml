    <abstract>The Gas Sensing Metrology Group at NIST provides accurate, stable gaseous standards for use in various types of emissions testing and environmental monitoring. The group develops and maintains the highest level of primary gas standards, which provide direct traceability to the International System of Units (SI). This traceability is then realized through the certification and dissemination of reference gas standards, such as NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs). Gas mixture SRMs are produced by a specialty gas company, analyzed by NIST against primary gas standards, and sold to customers to provide traceability for their gas measurements. This document provides an overview of the gas metrology program at NIST, and describes the general procedures which are used to develop and certify gas mixture SRMs.</abstract>
