    <abstract>This report documents NIST's execution of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Face Recognition Prize Challenge 2017. The (FRPC) was conducted to assess the capability of contemporary face recognition algorithms to recognize faces in photographs collected without tight quality constraints e.g. non-ideal images collected from individuals who are unaware of, and not cooperating with, the collection. Such images are characterized by variations in head orientation, facial expression, illumination, and also occlusion and reduced resolution.</abstract>
