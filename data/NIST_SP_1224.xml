    <abstract>The performance of a building and its functionality after a natural hazard event depend on multiple factors, including the original design and the current condition and capacity of the building to resist the risks posed by hazards. Building functionality also depends on the condition of the supporting infrastructure and the availability of utilities supplied to the building. Rapid recovery or uninterrupted operation of buildings can minimize disruptions to the community, decrease costs associated with repair and rebuilding, and lessen the overall economic burdens on communities and individuals impacted by natural hazards. However, given the range of age and condition of buildings across a community, there are often situations where the built environment does not perform well during natural hazard events. To address this gap between current and desired performance of buildings, Congress tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to identify research needs and implementation activities that would help improve building performance in case of a natural hazard. This mandate would expand the application of immediate occupancy performance beyond critical buildings, such as hospitals, to other buildings that are important to residents, businesses, and the broader community. With a longstanding focus on preserving lives, building codes help reduce the likelihood of significant damage or structural collapse and provide some degree of property protection. But current codes generally do not address continued functionality after a hazard event. With the damage and losses the nation and communities have been experiencing following natural hazard events, there is interest in understanding what would be required to move beyond the current design paradigm to include functionality. For example, an apartment building may be uninhabitable after an earthquake due to expected structural damage or after a wind hazard event due to damage to the building envelope. The resulting economic and social disruption caused by the displacement of residents is significant and is compounded when residential and commercial buildings across the community are similarly damaged. To address this problem and move toward development of a new immediate occupancy performance objective, this report identifies a large portfolio of research and implementation activities that target enhanced performance objectives for residential and commercial buildings. This exploratory report provides information about steps that could be taken; NIST is not charged with making recommendations about the desirability, practicality, or government or private sector resources that would be needed to carry out these actions if a decision is made to give immediate occupancy greater attention. These potential activities developed by NIST were aided by a steering committee of individual experts and informed by additional stakeholder input, including a national workshop hosted by NIST in January 2018. Four primary topic areas were identified: 1) building design, 2) community considerations, 3) economic and social considerations, and 4) acceptance and adoption considerations. If a decision is made to advance immediate occupancy performance goals, these topics need to be addressed concurrently through cooperative efforts among researchers, engineers, standards and code officials, and community stakeholders to reach the next level of building design and performance.</abstract>
