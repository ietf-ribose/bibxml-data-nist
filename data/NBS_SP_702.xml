    <abstract>To assist in building a computerized information system on the engineering properties of materials, the standards and metadata requirements for a representative group of mechanical property categories are considered. These categories include: tensile behavior, hardness numbers, notch-bar impact test parameters and fatigue properties. For each property group, definitions of terms, synonyms (and non-synonyms), standard test methods, standards for reporting data, precision and accuracy, and correlations of properties are addressed. The principal findings and recommendations are as follows. Existing test methods are generally adequate for the properties considered but better standards are needed for data reporting. Appraisal of materials variability and testing machine variability would be assisted by acess to standard reference materials, certified as to their mechanical properties.</abstract>
