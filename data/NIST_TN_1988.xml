    <abstract>Refrigerant working fluids have been predicted to be large contributors to the increase in radiative forcing of the earth. Consequently, existing compounds will soon be phased out. Low- GWP replacements exist, but they tend to be mildly flammable, and there is a need to understand their flammability properties so that effective building codes and standards can be written to address their application. The burning velocities of interest are in the range of 1 cm/s to 10 cm/s, and hence are challenging to measure. To understand the challenges and properties of the new agents, experimental measurements and numerical predictions have been made for representative refrigerant-air mixtures. Burning velocities were measured using a constant pressure spherical chamber with high-speed imaging of the shadowgraph image of the propagating spherical flame. The flame propagation rate as a function of flame radius was used to estimate the effects of stretch, and to determine the un-stretched laminar burning velocity. For comparison, the burning velocity was also predicted numerically using a detailed kinetic mechanism for hydrofluorocarbon combustion developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</abstract>
