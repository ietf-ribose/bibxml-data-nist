    <abstract>Buckling-Restrained Braced Frames (BRBFs) are one of the newer types of seismic force-resisting systems used in modern building designs. This Guide addresses the seismic design of steel BRBFs in typical building applications within regions of moderate to high seismic hazard, corresponding to Seismic Design Categories (SDC) C through F as defined in ASCE 7.This Guide was written to provide guidance to practicing structural engineers regarding the use of requirements in applicable codes and standards for the design of BRBF systems. The Guide is also useful to others seeking to understand the basis of, and to correctly implement, the appropriate code provisions related to BRBFs, including building officials, educators, researchers, and students.</abstract>
