    <abstract>High-performance computing (HPC) is a vital computational infrastructure for processing large data volumes, performing complex simulations, and conducting advanced machine learning model training. As such, HPC is a critical component of scientific discovery, innovation, and economic competitiveness. Cybersecurity thus plays an important role in HPC by safeguarding against abuse and misuse and ensuring data and research integrity. However, HPC systems often have unique hardware, software, and user environments that pose distinct cybersecurity challenges. This collaborative workshop gathered stakeholders from government, academia, and industry to discuss community needs, ongoing activities, and future directions in HPC security. This public workshop report provides detailed summaries of technical sessions, key takeaways from breakout sessions, and a summary of the keynote presentations.</abstract>
