    <abstract>This paper is a summary of our current recommendations for iris camera selection. NIST is developing these recommendations in collaboration with the FBI, other US Government entities with interests in the use of iris recognition technology, and the larger iris recognition community. It is intended to give brief, practical guidance to persons planning to purchase iris recognition cameras, particularly for use in law enforcement activities. It is also intended as a basis for an ongoing discussion on camera selection that began at the Iris Expert Group meeting in June 2018. The primary focus of these recommendations is compliance with standards and processes that enable interchange of data between government entities, as permitted by regulation and policy, and that enable cost effective improvements as technology advances.</abstract>
