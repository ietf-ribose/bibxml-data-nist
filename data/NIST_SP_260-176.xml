    <abstract>This report documents the procedures used to develop certified maximum force and absorbed energy values for SRM 2112 and SRM 2113. The report serves to provide outside observers with accurate and detailed information on how the materials were certified and how the impact verification program is conducted. The 2112 and 2113 SRMs have certified absorbed energy values at 21 degrees C and -40 degrees C, and a certified maximum force value at 21 degrees C.</abstract>
