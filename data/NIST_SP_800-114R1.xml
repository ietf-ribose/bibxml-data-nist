    <abstract>Many people telework, and they use a variety of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access websites, review and edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Each telework device is controlled by the organization, a third party (such as the organization s contractors, business partners, and vendors), or the teleworker; the latter is known as bring your own device (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations for securing BYOD devices used for telework and remote access, as well as those directly attached to the enterprise s own networks.</abstract>
