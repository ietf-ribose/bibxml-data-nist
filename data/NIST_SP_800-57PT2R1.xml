    <abstract>NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-57 provides cryptographic key management guidance. It consists of three parts. Part 1 provides general guidance and best practices for the management of cryptographic keying material. Part 2 provides guidance on policy and security planning requirements. Finally, Part 3 provides guidance when using the cryptographic features of current systems. Part 2 (this document) 1) identifies the concepts, functions and elements common to effective systems for the management of symmetric and asymmetric keys; 2) identifies the security planning requirements and documentation necessary for effective institutional key management; 3) describes Key Management Specification requirements; 4) describes cryptographic Key Management Policy documentation that is needed by organizations that use cryptography; and 5) describes Key Management Practice Statement requirements. Appendices provide examples of some key management infrastructures and supplemental documentation and planning materials.</abstract>
