    <abstract>Space is a newly emerging commercial critical infrastructure sector that is no longer the domain of only national government authorities. Space is an inherently risky environment in which to operate, so cybersecurity risks involving commercial space – including those affecting commercial satellite vehicles – need to be understood and managed alongside other types of risks to ensure safe and successful operations. This report provides a general introduction to cybersecurity risk management for the commercial satellite industry as they seek to start managing cybersecurity risks in space. This document is by no means comprehensive in terms of addressing all of the cybersecurity risks to commercial satellite infrastructure, nor does it explore risks to satellite vehicles, which may be introduced through the implementation of cybersecurity controls. The intent is to present basic concepts, generate discussions, and provide sample references for additional information on pertinent cybersecurity risk management models.</abstract>
