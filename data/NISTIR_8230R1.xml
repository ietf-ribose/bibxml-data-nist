    <abstract>The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP) was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplement community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various regulations, including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). Exercise N of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (chromium), contaminants (arsenic, cadmium, and lead), water-soluble vitamins (folic acid), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin D2 and vitamin D3), fatty acids, and botanical marker compounds (ginsenosides) in foods and/or botanical dietary supplement ingredients and finished products.</abstract>
