    <abstract>The Food Nutrition and Safety Measurements Quality Assurance Program (FNSQAP) was launched in 2021. FNSQAP was established to assist laboratories in the development and validation of new analytical methods, in improving the quality of their analytical measurements, and in supporting compliance with federal regulations enforced by the FDA, USDA, and other international bodies. Exercise 2 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (chromium, molybdenum, selenium), toxic elements (cadmium, lead), water-soluble vitamins (choline, carnitine), fat-soluble vitamins (carotenoids), fatty acids (DHA, ARA), and contaminants (glyphosate and metabolites; phthalates) in food and infant formula samples.</abstract>
