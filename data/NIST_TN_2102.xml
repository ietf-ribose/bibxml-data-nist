    <abstract>This report documents heat release rate measurements of various transient combustibles; that is, non-permanent items found in industrial settings that can potentially contribute to an accidental fire. These items are often included in hypothetical fire scenarios that are modeled as part of risk analyses. Of particular interest in these experiments is the functional relationship between the peak heat release rate and the number of replicate items.</abstract>
