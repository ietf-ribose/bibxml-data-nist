    <abstract>The safety of Automated Driving System (ADS) equipped vehicles and reliable methods for assessing that safety are critical for successfully deploying these engineered systems into the market. This document presents a novel approach for developing an ADS safety measurement methodology, which came from the NIST Automated Driving System Safety Measurement (ADSSM) Technical Working Group. The new approach brings together the concept of an Operating Envelope Specification (OES) a structured description of environmental factors or aspects that an ADS may encounter during operation and the NIST Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems.</abstract>
