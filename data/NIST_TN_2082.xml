    <abstract>This report documents a series of time-averaged gas species measurements made along the centerline of methanol, ethanol, and acetone pool fires steadily burning in a quiescent environment. All gas species measurements are obtained using a Gas Chromatograph/ Mass Spectrometer System (GC/MS). Measurements were made at different heights along the centerline of the fire and repeated at least twice for each location. Gas species volume fractions were determined via the GC/MS using predetermined calibration factors. Soot mass fractions are simultaneously measured during the gas sampling process. The gas species volume and soot mass fractions are compared at different heights within the fire and across a variety of different fuels. Other fire parameters are measured as well, including time-averaged temperature measurements and mass burning rates.</abstract>
