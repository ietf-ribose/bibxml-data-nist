    <abstract>This guide provides small-to-medium sized businesses (SMB), specifically those who have modest or no cybersecurity plans in place, with considerations to kick-start their cybersecurity risk management strategy by using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The guide also can assist other relatively small organizations, such as non-profits, government agencies, and schools. It is a supplement to the NIST CSF and is not intended to replace it.</abstract>
