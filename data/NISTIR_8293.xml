    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established a Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS) in 2009. The VitDQAP at NIST administered twelve interlaboratory comparison exercises through 2016 for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites in human serum and plasma. The comparability of participant measurements for target analytes improved substantially over time through the development and promulgation of robust measurement technologies, identification and production of suitable reference materials, isolation and identification of measurement system biases, and support and encouragement of within-laboratory measurement quality control efforts. This VitDQAP Final Report summarizes the program and provides highlights of the twelve exercises conducted during the program's eight-year lifetime.</abstract>
