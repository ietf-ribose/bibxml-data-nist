    <abstract>A series of measurements was made to characterize the structure of a moderate-sized methanol pool fire steadily burning in a quiescent environment. Time averaged local measurements of temperature and gas species concentrations were made in a steadily burning methanol pool fire. Temperatures were measured using fine wire thermocouples corrected for radiative losses. Gaseous species were measured using extractive sampling through a cooled probe and the samples analyzed using a gas chromatograph. The species measured included the reactants (the fuel, methanol, and oxygen), combustion intermediates such as CO and combustion products such as H2O and CO2. It is anticipated that these data will be useful for model validation.</abstract>
