    <abstract>The predominant application architecture for cloud-native applications consists of multiple microservices, accompanied in some instances by a centralized application infrastructure, such as a service mesh, that provides all application services. This class of applications is generally developed using a flexible and agile software development paradigm called DevSecOps. A salient feature of this paradigm is the use of flow processes called continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which initially take the software through various stages (e.g., build, test, package, and deploy) in the form of source code through operations that constitute the software supply chain (SSC) in order to deliver a new version of software. This document outlines strategies for integrating SSC security measures into CI/CD pipelines.</abstract>
