    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently released SRM 1568c Rice Flour which has value assignments for over 30 analytes, including arsenic species. This material is intended to be used for the evaluation of methods for the determination of elements and arsenic species in this and similar matrices. The material was purchased from commercial vendors. Measurement results were obtained from NIST and interlaboratory comparison exercises. This document describes the material, sample preparations, results, and data analysis.</abstract>
