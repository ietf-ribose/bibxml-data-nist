    <abstract>The definition of 'kind of quantity' given in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM), 3rd edition, does not cover the historical meaning of the term as it is most commonly used in metrology. Most of its historical meaning has been merged into 'quantity,' which is polysemic across two layers of abstraction. I propose a model of 'kind of quantity' that is compatible with its historical meaning and distinguishable from 'quantity in a general sense.'</abstract>
