    <abstract>This report summarizes the results of a workshop held at NIST on July 27, 2017. The goal of this workshop was to introduce participants to the newly constructed Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF). Over 40 attendees were provided with the UCEF environment which is contained in a virtual machine. They were presented with the background on UCEF and the technologies included. They additionally were led through an exercise of using the tool suite to develop a joint federated experiment.</abstract>
