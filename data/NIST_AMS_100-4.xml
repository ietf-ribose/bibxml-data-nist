    <abstract>Valuable information was gathered from a broad representation of the additive manufacturing (AM) community (150 attendees from industry, government, academic, and regulatory agencies) during this workshop to understand what is needed to enable broader acceptance and increased use of metal AM in fatigue and fracture critical applications. The main needs identified during the workshop were: comprehensive understanding of processing-structure-properties (PSP) relationships, mature process and material models, trustworthy in-process monitoring and control, effective non-destructive inspection techniques, predictive design tools, and traditional and rapid qualification frameworks. Fatigue and fracture issues play the largest role in PSP relationships, and during the workshop many specific areas of interest were identified and prioritized. In general, PSP investigations should consider statistical variation an utilize both experimental and modeling efforts. A curated AM materials database was deemed highly beneficial to the PSP effort. PSP understanding will facilitate development of in-process monitoring and control, non-destructive inspection techniques, and predictive design tools. The main standardization opportunities identified include standard reporting procedures for AM to enhance understanding and facilitate comparison to other results. Evaluation of current fatigue and fracture test methods as well as non-destructive inspection methods was another standardization need. Finally, a standardized traditional AM qualification framework using the currently available AM processes and inspection techniques was deemed highly necessary, and many felt that regulatory agencies should lead this effort.</abstract>
