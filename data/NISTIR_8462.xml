    <abstract>Mobile applications are pervasive in the public and private sectors. Enterprises in these sectors should evaluate the mobile applications used within their infrastructures for vulnerabilities to minimize potential risk. The SATE VI Mobile track seeks to improve the tools and services used in these evaluations by extending the Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) to include mobile application tool evaluations. This document describes NIST s first attempt to carry out that goal and the results that stemmed from the first Mobile SATE track.</abstract>
