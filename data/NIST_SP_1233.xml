    <abstract>In response to needs of a government-wide initiative in nanotechnology led by a subcommittee within the White House s Office of Science and Technology Policy, NIST established a nanotechnology environmental, health, and safety (nano-EHS) research program in 2009 that remained active through 2016. This document summarizes the NIST Nano-EHS Program goals, projects, outputs, and impacts. The program was designed to address, in collaboration with other agencies, the research needs for a comprehensive U.S. measurement infrastructure for nano-EHS as identified by federal agencies participating in the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Such an infrastructure included a suite of measurement tools methods, protocols, standards (reference materials and documentary), instruments, models, and benchmark (validated) data. The NIST Nano-EHS Program made substantial progress in developing the required infrastructure, producing 9 reference materials, 24 web-accessible protocols, and 212 archival journal articles, 59% of which have been published in journals with impact factors greater than 3. In addition, program team members held leadership positions in the nanotechnology committees of major standards development organizations and led and contributed to the development of standards in these committees.</abstract>
