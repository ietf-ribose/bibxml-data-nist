    <abstract>Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) contains a method and the associated information requirements for quality management and risk analysis. FMEA is applicable to manufacturing processes and product design. Quality Information Framework (QIF) is a standard that covers the quality measurement and analysis phase within a model based enterprise (MBE) for manufacturing. An information model, developed in Extensible Markup Language (XML) for FMEA is described in this paper and is proposed to be included as a part of QIF. This paper also identifies key information sharing between FMEA and QIF.</abstract>
