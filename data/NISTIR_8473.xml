    <abstract>This document is the Cybersecurity Framework Profile (Profile) developed for the Electric Vehicle Extreme Fast Charging (EV/XFC) ecosystem and the subsidiary functions that support each of the four domains: (i) Electric Vehicles (EV); (ii) Extreme Fast Charging (XFC); (iii) XFC Cloud or Third-Party Operations; and (iv) Utility and Building Networks. This Profile provides a foundational profile that relevant parties may use to develop profiles specific to their organization to assess their cybersecurity posture as a part of their risk management process. The profile is intended to supplement, not replace, an existing risk management program or the current cybersecurity standards, regulations, and industry guidelines that are in current use by the EV/XFC industry.</abstract>
