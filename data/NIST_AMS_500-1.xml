    <abstract>Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important enabler of Industry 4.0 but there are several hurdles that need to be overcome to realize the full potential of AM. These challenges include the need for a data infrastructure that supports the sharing of data generated by the technologies as they mature, and data interoperability is critical to a sustainable data infrastructure that is widely accessible. This paper outlines the need for building a common data stack for an interoperable AM data infrastructure. At the foundation is a common data dictionary (CDD),which defines a primary technical vocabulary for the AM community in logical buckets. On top of the CDD is a common data model (CDM), which defines the hierarchy and relationships of the terms in the CDD and enables the data to be linkable in a complex data system. The CDM empowers information integration and sharing throughout the lifecycles and value chains for different AM technologies. The comprehensiveness of the properties defined in the CDM makes AM data reusable. To enable the exchange of data between different systems, common data exchange formats (CDEFs) transform the CDM into targeted data packages. The design philosophy of the CDD, CDM, and CDEF are described to accelerate the development and adoption of AM technologies across alliances.</abstract>
