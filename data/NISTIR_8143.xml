    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established a Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements. Participants in the eleventh exercise of this program, the Summer 2015 Comparability Study, were asked to use the methodology of their choice to measure concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in pooled human serum control and study materials distributed by NIST. The study materials consisted of VitDQAP-I and VitDQAP-II (materials designed for the VitDQAP). Standard Reference Material (SRM) 968d Fat-Soluble Vitamins, Carotenoids, and Cholesterol in Human Serum Level 1 was provided as a control material. Participants provided their data to NIST, where it was compiled and evaluated for trueness relative to the NIST value and concordance within the participant community. A report of results was provided to all participants of the study, and laboratories were identified by code numbers known only to them. The results from this eleventh study are reported along with a summary of the analytical methods used.</abstract>
