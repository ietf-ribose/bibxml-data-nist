    <abstract>This paper quantifies the pool boiling performance of R1336mzz(Z), and R123 on a flattened, horizontal Turbo-ESP surface for heat fluxes between roughly 10 kWm-2 and 120 kWm-2. The study showed that the boiling performance of R1336mzz(Z) on the TurboESP did not differ statistically from that of R123 for heat fluxes between 13 kWm-2 and59 kWm-2. For heat fluxes larger than 59 kWm-2, the R123 boiling heat flux was up to 5 % larger than the heat flux for R1336mzz(Z). For heat fluxes between 4 kWm-2and 13 kWm-2, the R123 heat flux was approximately 53 % larger than that of R1336mzz(Z). The R1336mzz(Z) pool boiling curve was measured for three saturation temperatures and exhibited an optimum with respect to saturation temperature near the middle saturation temperature of 298.1 K. A pool boiling model from the present authors was modified to include a single-phase transfer term and was used to predict both single-component and multi-component performance of the test refrigerants on the Turbo-ESP surface. For most heat fluxes, the modified model predicted the measured superheat to within +/- 0.5 K.</abstract>
