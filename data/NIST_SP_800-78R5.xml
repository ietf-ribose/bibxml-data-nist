    <abstract>Federal Information Processing Standard 201-3 (FIPS 201-3) defines the requirements for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) life cycle activities, including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-3 also defines the structure of an identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-3, as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-3 and the related NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and SP 800-76, Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, which rely on cryptographic functions.
