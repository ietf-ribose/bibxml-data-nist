    <abstract>The ASTM E3012 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes provides guidelines for formally characterizing manufacturing processes. However, the difficulty that has arisen in the early use of the standard illustrates the need for intuitive tools for helping modeling experts to conform to the specified information model. The Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) Builder was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to provide a visual interface for helping modeling experts to conform to the specified ASTM information model. The UMP Builder, a browser-based tool, integrates symbolic mathematical and guided textual inputs, helping to consistently record manufacturing process models for environmental sustainability into a repository. The Builder also serves as a curator by providing capabilities to explore and visualize models recorded in the Builder repository. The UMP Builder is adapted from of an open source tool called the Configurable Data Curation System (CDCS) developed at NIST. The CDCS was originally developed to capture, share, and transform materials data, allowing users to upload an XML schema and create instances of that schema. In the UMP Builder, the schema used for creating the models is frozen. The schema follows the guidelines from the ASTM E3012 standard. The Builder also provides unique features that are specific in order to facilitate the modelling of UMPs. This user s guide aims to provide guidelines to use the UMP Builder. To obtain more information (especially on the architecture), please refer to the CDCS documentation.</abstract>
