    <abstract>The 2017 edition of NIST Handbook 150-22 incorporates changes resulting from revisions to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) Version 1.1, the Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) Testing and Certification Program Manual Version 2.0, and the EAC Voting System Test Laboratory Program Manual Version 2.0., as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-22 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Voting System Testing program.
