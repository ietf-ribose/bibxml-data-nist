    <abstract>This report describes work that measured the three dimensional emission patterns for a variety of user equipment (UE) handset devices operating on long-term evolution (LTE) protocols. This effort was part of a National Advanced Spectrum and Communication Test Network (NASCTN) project sponsored by the Defense Spectrum Organization (DSO) to investigate the factors that influence aggregate LTE UE emissions in the advanced wireless service 3 (AWS-3) band and the sensitivity of the emissions to those factors. The work presented in this technical note supported the NASCTN's 'Aggregate LTE: Characterizing UE Emissions' project outcomes by ensuring the best orientation and associated uncertainty for transmission was known for each UE tested. Due to the potential benefit to the broader spectrum community, this work is being released as a stand-along technical report as well as an appendix to the final 'Aggregate LTE: Characterizing UE Emissions' technical report</abstract>
