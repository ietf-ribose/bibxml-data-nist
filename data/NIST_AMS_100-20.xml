    <abstract>This annual report characterizes US innovation and industrial competitiveness in manufacturing. It includes tracking domestic manufacturing activity and its domestic supply chain in order to develop a quantitative depiction of US manufacturing in the context of the domestic economy and global industry. This depiction provides change agents, such as public entities and trade groups that invest in advancing the current state of manufacturing, insight into the current state and recent trends in US manufacturing. The report further identifies areas of manufacturing that can have large impacts on costs.</abstract>
