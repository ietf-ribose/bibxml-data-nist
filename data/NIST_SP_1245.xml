    <abstract>On March 18-19, 2019, NIST held a workshop on Large Outdoor Fire Modeling (LOFM) to assess the state of the art in computational fire modeling and to identify a set of research priorities for driving progress in the development of large outdoor fire models. This workshop was broadly concerned with large outdoor fires that have the potential to negatively impact communities or the environment. In this context, wildfires, wildland and wildlandurban interface (WUI) fires, post-earthquake fires, oil spill cleanup, and community-scale structural conflagrations may all be classified as large outdoor fires. The premise of the workshop was that modeling tools may assist in mitigating the large outdoor fire problem or at least in developing a better understanding of the problem. The group looked at the modeling problem in three different areas: (1) operational modeling, (2)forensic reconstruction, and (3) planning, such as prescribed burns or forest fuels management. Operational models mostly empirical rate of spread models were classified as running much faster than real time, with simple user interfaces. These models are useful for forecasting and generating large ensembles of fire scenarios for risk analysis. Forensic models usually need to be run at landscape scale to capture terrain features and incorporate weather effects. High-fidelity, physics-based models may be used for understanding detailed phenomena, forensics, or for planning purposes. The physics-based models tend to be limited by the level of resolution available for input parameters and by the stochastic and chaotic nature of real fire events. A survey of available models is presented in this report. Approximately 50 onsite and 20 online attendees participated in the workshop. Plenary presentations where given by Chris Lautenberger of REAX Engineering, Janice Coen of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Rod Linn of Los Alamos National Laboratory. These lectures laid out the state of the art in operational rate of spread models, fire-weather interaction, and physics-based models, respectively, providing a baseline for workshop discussions. Details of the workshop process are given in the report. Three breakout groups, each with a balanced makeup of fire-related expertise (from first responders to high-performance computing experts), convened to address user needs, identify research gaps in outdoor fire models, and to suggest a set of grand challenge problems to focus research efforts with a ten year horizon.</abstract>
