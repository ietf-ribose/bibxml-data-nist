    <abstract>This paper describes the probability of successful delivery (PSuD) measurement method for every word critical (EWC) and average message intelligibility (AMI) mission-critical voice (MCV) communications contexts. The PSuD measurement is a component of the MCV quality of experience (QoE) system developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research Division (PSCR). In this paper, we present the probabilityiser (PBI), a tool that simulates an unreliable audio channel. Using the PBI we validate the PSuD measurement and demonstrate the measurementâ€™s utility on audio encoded with various codecs.</abstract>
