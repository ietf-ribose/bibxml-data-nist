    <abstract>The 2018 National Institute of Standards and Technology Environmental Scan provide an analysis of the external factors that can influence NIST and the fulfillment of its mission as the agency looks to create a strategic plan for the coming years. The analysis was conducted through four separate lenses: Societal, Political, Geopolitical, and Technological. Observations highlighted range for the unique political climate NIST currently faces to challenges to NIST's leadership in metrology to the new opportunities provided new breakthrough technology innovations. Interfaced together, this scan aims to provide a wholistic view of the environment NIST faces moving forward.</abstract>
