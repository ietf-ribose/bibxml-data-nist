    <abstract>Urinary excretion of albumin is a major diagnostic and prognostic marker of kidney disease; therefore, accurate measurement of urine albumin is essential to clinical diagnosis. To support the accuracy and comparability of clinical urine albumin measurements, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has partnered with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Laboratory Working Group (LWG) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Working Group for the Standardization of Albumin Assays in Urine (WG-SAU) to develop a reference measurement system for urine albumin. NIST has developed the foundational components of the reference measurement system for urine albumin, a series of higher-order reference materials and a reference measurement procedure (RMP), to establish a traceability scheme that will link clinical urine albumin to the International System of Units (SI). The NIST RMP for urine albumin is based on the detection and quantification of signature proteotypic (trypsin) albumin peptides via isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LCMS/MS) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The RMP incorporates an isotopically labeled (15N) full-length recombinant human serum albumin (15N-rHSA) material as the internal standard, which permits the absolute quantification of albumin in urine. Out of the 11 tryptic peptides selected to monitor the albumin in urine, 5 albumin peptides were used for the absolute quantification of albumin in urine. This publication outlines the NIST RMP for the absolute quantification of albumin in urine by ID-LC-MS/MS.</abstract>
