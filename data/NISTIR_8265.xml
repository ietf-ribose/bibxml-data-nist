    <abstract>The performance of body armor made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMMPE) is dependent on the tensile strength of UHMMPE fibers. UHMMPE is known to exhibit different mechanical properties when tested at different strain rates and different temperatures. The high tensile strength and low surface energy make it difficult to securely grip single fibers while testing without any slippage. Consequently, making accurate measurements of the tensile strength of this material is challenging. Efforts to simultaneously interrogate strain-rate and temperature conditions have been complicated by the difficulty in gripping the fiber, and in consistently heating a small (? 15 m diameter) fiber. In this paper, a method is described for tensile testing single UHMMPE fibers at high rates and high temperatures, focusing on an innovative clamp design and a specialized single fiber heater that can be coupled to traditional tools for measuring mechanical properties of fibers. Metrics of success for the single fiber clamps are described based on the percentage of failures observed at the jaw grips and the strain to failure.</abstract>
