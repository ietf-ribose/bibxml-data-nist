    <abstract>Industrial users of ISO 10303 STandard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP) protocols needed the ability to exchange design product data that is in conformance with recently updated ISO geometric product specification (GPS) standards, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) dimensioning and tolerancing standard, and recently updated digital product data definition practice standards. Updates to those standards were made to support continued migration from drawing-based product and manufacturing information (PMI) exchange to full model-based exchange, sharing and management across life-cycle viewpoints (i.e., design to fabrication to inspection). The aerospace and automotive industries created a joint project to merge ISO 10303-203: Configuration controlled 3D design (AP 203) [1] and ISO 10303-214: Core data for automotive mechanical design processes (AP 214) [2] into a new ISO 10303-242: Managed model-based 3D engineering (AP 242) [3] rather than pursue individual updates. Relevant STEP information models have been updated and new information models created to support the ASME and ISO standards, resulting in the publication of AP 242 in 2014.</abstract>
