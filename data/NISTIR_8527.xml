    <abstract>On September 5–8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held the second Standards and Performance Metrics for On‐Road Automated Vehicles Workshop. This four‐day virtual event provided updates on NIST’s recent work in automated vehicles (AVs) and gave stakeholders an opportunity to provide feedback and input on current and future NIST research. The workshop included high‐level keynote presentations, a series of industry keynote presentations, and NIST presentations on its current AV activities. The industry keynotes and NIST presentations were paired with breakout sessions that discussed NIST’s progress, community challenges, and stakeholder research needs in six key areas: systems interaction, perception, cybersecurity, communications, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure. There was general agreement that developing standards allows for better comparisons and evaluations of emerging technologies. Other key themes included: 1) Digital technologies for automation and related security/privacy concerns, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and smart communication technologies (i.e., vehicle‐to‐vehicle (V2V), vehicle‐to‐infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle‐to‐everything (V2X)), 2) Need for standardized or common language to improve information sharing, 3) Open data sets to support and validate technical advances and standardization across system components and areas (i.e., standards evolving in parallel with technology), and 4) Pivotal role for NIST as a convener to bring diverse stakeholders together for knowledge exchange and cross‐industry dialogue.</abstract>
