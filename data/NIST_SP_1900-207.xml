    <abstract>This publication provides a Strategic Plan for the Smart City Infrastructure (SCI) program of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the research laboratory of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The SCI program manages the Global Community Technology Challenge (GCTC), a nationwide public-private partnership of cities and communities; local and state government agencies; and private-sector for-profit and non-profit entities. The GCTC is dedicated to improving the urban, suburban, and rural ecosystems and residents’ overall quality of life through the integration of advanced cyberphysical systems and Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies. NIST serves as coordinator for this partnership in collaboration with other federal agencies and offices that sponsor smart city-related projects and research activities. The convention “smart city,” is used generically throughout this document to represent any city, township, or community that develops, invests in, and integrates digital technologies to improve city services for the benefit of the community and its residents. This strategy is based on a consensus planning process chartered by the NIST SCI program in collaboration with the leadership of twelve GCTC technology sectors (i.e., working groups), who collectively represent over 220 regions, cities and communities that have initiated smart city programs or projects as GCTC member communities. This document aligns with the current Administration, Department of Commerce, and NIST strategic documents, and covers a planning period of three years, from 2024-2026.</abstract>
