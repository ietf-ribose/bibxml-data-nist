    <abstract>The purpose of this document is to provide instructions for using a newly developed TRNSYS component (Type277). Type277 utilizes socket communication to provide loosely-coupled integration between TRNSYS and Java-based components. Bi-directional flow of information is facilitated using the client-server architecture of Java. Type277 is compiled as both a 32-bit and 64-bit dynamic link library to support co-simulation with TRNSYS17 and TRNSYS18 projects. An application of Type277 is demonstrated by modifying an example TRNSYS project. The Java project and files, TRNSYS modified example projects, and Type277 dynamic link libraries are being made available to the public through the NIST GitHub site.</abstract>
