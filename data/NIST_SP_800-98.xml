    <abstract>This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the risks of RFID technology and security measures to mitigate those risks. It provides practical, real-world advice on how to initiate, design, implement and operate RFID systems in a manner that mitigates security and privacy risks. The document also provides background information on RFID applications, standards, and system components to assist in the understanding of RFID security risks and controls. This document presents information that is independent of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, and applications. The emphasis is on RFID systems that are based on industry and international standards, although the existence of proprietary approaches is noted when they offer relevant security features not found in current standards.</abstract>
