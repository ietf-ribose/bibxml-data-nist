    <abstract>This report summarizes the results of work performed for the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Applied Chemicals and Materials Division on the properties of polyol ester lubricants under interagency agreement number N0042115IP00008. The works includes purity analysis and assessment, decomposition studies, experimental measurements on density, isobaric heat capacity, speed of sound, vapor pressure, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and distillation curve measurement. Models were developed for the thermodynamic properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity that represent these properties to nearly within their experimental uncertainty for three pure polyol ester base fluids (pentaerythritol tetrapentanoate (POE5), pentaerythritol tetraheptanoate (POE7), pentaerythritol tetranonanoate (POE9), and a fully qualified lubricant meeting military specification MIL-PRF-23699.</abstract>
