    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Grid Program seeks to accelerate the development of conformity assessment or testing and certification (T) programs for smart grid interoperability standards to ensure that the implementations conform to the standards' requirements and therefore enhance interoperability of smart grid devices and systems. This document presents a review of the current state of T for smart grid standards using a set of metrics developed from functional aspects of the standards. These functional metrics include information model and model mapping, communication protocol and protocol mapping, device physical performance, test methodologies, guidelines and best practices, and cybersecurity. These metrics are used to analyze smart grid standards and the T availability of these standards was also evaluated. The 240 smart grid standards analyzed were drawn primarily from three resources: the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) Catalog of Standards (CoS), the 2014 release of NIST's Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards Release 3.0, and the Union of the Electricity Industry (EURELECTRIC) and European Distribution System Operator (EDSO) priorities for smart grid standardization position paper. The results of the smart grid standards T landscape analysis are provided in the report. These results indicate that only a small percentage of smart grid standards have available T programs.</abstract>
