    <abstract>The Engineering Principles for Information Technology (IT) Security (EP-ITS) presents a list of system-level security principles to be considered in the design, development, and operation of an information system. Ideally, the principles presented here would be used from the onset of a program⁰₄at the beginning of, or during the design phase⁰₄and then employed throughout the system⁰₉s life-cycle. However, these principles are also helpful in affirming and confirming the security posture of already deployed information systems. The principles are short and concise and can be used by organizations to develop their system life-cycle policies.</abstract>
