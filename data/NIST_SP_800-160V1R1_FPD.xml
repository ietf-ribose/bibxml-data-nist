    <abstract>This publication provides a basis for establishing a discipline for systems security engineering (SSE) as part of systems engineering and does so in terms of its principles, concepts, activities, and tasks. The publication also demonstrates how those SSE principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be effectively applied to systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless of its purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or stage of its system life cycle. Ultimately, the intent of the material is to advance the field of SSE as a discipline that can be applied and studied and to serve as a basis for the development of educational and training programs, including the development of professional certifications and other assessment criteria.</abstract>
