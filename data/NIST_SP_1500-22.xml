    <abstract>A workshop was held at the EDF offices in Washington, DC, on June 15 and 16, 2022, to discuss the current state of knowledge and to define productive courses of action in better determination and source apportionment of methane emission rates, and specifically, natural gas emission rates, in urban environments. The workshop involved 56 attendees from universities, government agencies, NGOs and the private sector, including representatives from relevant utilities. This report covers discussion of the knowledge base to date about urban sources of natural gas (NG) methane emissions, their relative magnitudes, and areas of uncertainty. Specific suggestions and ideas for future experiments to be conducted that could improve our understanding are presented. Next steps, including the creation of working groups for field experiments and/or a research coordination network are discussed.</abstract>
