    <abstract>Designed around Industry 4.0 based digital technology, flexible manufacturing cells are envisioned to comprise a variety of machines capable of peer-to-peer communication, learning, and adaptation with the end goal of creating a standards-based, brand-agnostic, autonomously managed work cell free of any human influence. In this project, CCAM developed a physical and digital flexible manufacturing cell built primarily on open standards and open-source technologies to address the opportunities and challenges of development of a strong communication framework, as well as the semantics and context to drive individual decision making down to the machine or controller and enable brand-agnostic interoperability. This reference implementation of a full digital and flexible manufacturing cell can be used for the further development of standards and technologies surrounding the digital thread and distributed manufacturing.</abstract>
