    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 3666 Albumin and Creatinine in Frozen Human Urine (Level 1 to Level 4) delivers certified values for albumin and creatinine in human urine. The material is intended for 1) use in validating measurement procedures and 2) use in qualifying control materials produced in-house and analyzed using measurement methods for the determination of albumin, creatinine, or the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in human urine. A unit of SRM 3666 consists of four (4) vials of frozen pooled human urine with endogenous levels of albumin determined using the NIST candidate reference measurement procedure (RMP) for albumin in urine [1]; and creatinine determined using the NIST RMP for creatinine in serum [2]. The certified values and associated uncertainties for albumin and creatinine were used to calculate the ACR for each level (Level 1 to Level 4). This publication documents the production, measurement processes, results, and statistical evaluations involved in the production and certification of SRM 3666.</abstract>
