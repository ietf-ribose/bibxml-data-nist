    <abstract>At the request of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) and in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted the fourth Fatty Acid Quality Assurance Program (FAQAP) interlaboratory study of fatty acid (FA) concentrations in human serum. This 2017 FAQAP study included measurements of free FAs (extraction and measurement prior to acid/base hydrolysis) and total FAs (measurement after acid/base hydrolysis). Participants were requested to analyze SRM 1950 Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma as a control, three unknown sera, and a free fatty acid (FFA) solution. Participants measuring fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derivatives of FAs were asked to analyze a FAME solution. The results from this fourth exercise are reported along with a summary of the analytical methods used by the 14 participating laboratories.</abstract>
