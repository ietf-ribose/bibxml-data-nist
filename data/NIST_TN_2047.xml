    <abstract>This study reports on the change in flammability of cotton fabrics caused by water-insoluble gel coatings applied from a single bath solution formulated with polymeric micelles and flame retardant amphiphiles. The flame resistant coatings are made from low concentration aqueous formulations of polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide, and 5 % to 15 % mass fraction melamine and sodium hexametaphosphate. The coated cotton fabrics were tested and characterized by a variety of bench-scale tools, such as vertical flame testing, micro-scale combustion calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Properties such as increased ignition resistance, self-extinguishment, and higher decomposition temperatures were measured, relative to the uncoated cotton.</abstract>
