    <abstract>In this work, we compiled and evaluated various properties pertaining to the heats of combustion of about 420 compounds of physical, chemical, and engineering interest. This includes boiling points, melting points, latent heats (enthalpies) of vaporization, heats (enthalpies) of fusion, heats (enthalpies) of formation and combustion, and heat capacities (specific heats).</abstract>
