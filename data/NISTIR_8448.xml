    <abstract>The Health Assessment Measurements Quality Assurance Program (HAMQAP) was launched in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements in samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human metabolism (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum of health assessment. Exercise 6 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in house measurements of nutritional elements (chlorine, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium), toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury), contaminants (chlorate and perchlorate, glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)), water-soluble vitamins (biotin and vitamin C), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A and E), fatty acids (select omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids), botanicals (anthocyanidins), natural products (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline), and proximates (fat, protein, carbohydrates, solids, ash, and calories) in foods and dietary supplements, and corresponding biomarkers/metabolites in clinical specimens (human red blood cells).</abstract>
