    <abstract>The selective application of technological and related procedural safeguards is an important responsibility of every federal organization in providing adequate security in its computer and telecommunication systems. This standard is applicable to all federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to provide adequate information security for all agency operations and assets as defined in 15 U.S.C. ยง 278g-3. This standard shall be used in designing and implementing cryptographic modules that federal departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under contract. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design, implementation and operation of a cryptographic module. These areas include cryptographic module specification; cryptographic module interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; software/firmware security; operating environment; physical security; non-invasive security; sensitive security parameter management; self-tests; life-cycle assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</abstract>
