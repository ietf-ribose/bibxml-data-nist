    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a prototype field test standard (FTS) that incorporates three test methods that could be used by state weights and measures inspectors to periodically test the accuracy of fuel delivery at retail hydrogen gas vehicle refueling dispensers, much as gasoline dispensers are tested today. The three field test methods are: 1) gravimetric, 2) Pressure, Volume, Temperature (PVT), and 3) master meter. The FTS was tested in NIST s Transient Flow Facility with helium gas and in the field at a hydrogen dispenser location. This document describes the design and construction of the test standard, necessary safety instrumentation for working with high pressure hydrogen gas, how to execute tests with the FTS, and the operating specifications of the FTS components. This document is intended to aid others attempting to design and construct similar apparatuses.</abstract>
