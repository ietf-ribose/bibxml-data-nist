    <abstract>This is the third in a series of reports on ongoing face recognition vendor tests (FRVT) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The first two reports cover, respectively, the performance of one-to-one face recognition algorithms used for verification of asserted identities, and performance of one-to-many face recognition algorithms used for identification of individuals in photo data bases. This document extends those evaluations to document accuracy variations across demographic groups</abstract>
