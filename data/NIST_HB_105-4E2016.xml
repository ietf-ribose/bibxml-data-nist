    <abstract>These specifications and tolerances are recommended as minimum requirements for standards used by state and local weights and measures officials and others in the regulatory verification of meters used in quantity determination of pressurized liquid commodities. Other users may find this handbook helpful in the design of volumetric standards for measuring pressurized liquid commodities, but the requirements should not be considered mandatory for special applications outside the scope of regulatory weights and measures.</abstract>
