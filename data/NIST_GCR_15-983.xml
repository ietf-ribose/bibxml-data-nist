    <abstract>This white paper presents the current, international, state-of-the-art large-scale experimental, modeling, and performance-based design (PBD) efforts related to structural fire resistance of concrete structures. The paper addresses these topics with emphasis on research and development needs for large-scale experiments on fire resistance of structures to support performance-based engineering and structure-fire model validation; prioritizing those needs; phasing the needs in terms of near, medium and long term; identifying the most appropriate international laboratory facilities and collaborators available to address each need; identifying possible means to transfer the results of research to industry; and identifying a means for the coalition of international partners to review progress and exchange information on a regular basis.</abstract>
