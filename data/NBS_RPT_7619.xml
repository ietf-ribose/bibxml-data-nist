    <abstract>Radio system parameters are combined with geophysical and ionospheric characteristics to predict the performance of high frequency sky-wave communication circuits through the use of electronic computers. A program is presented to compute Maximum Usable Frequencies, Optimum Traffic Frequencies, Lowest Useful Frequencies, probable mode of propagation, angle of arrival, circuit reliability, system loss, available signal-to-noise and field strength. Numerical representation is used for all parameters not expressed in closed mathematical form.</abstract>
