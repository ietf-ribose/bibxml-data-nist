    <abstract>A cryostat and equilibrium vessel together with auxiliary apparatus for establishing equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases of solutions of low boiling material by a circulation method is described. The equilibrium vessel incorporates a novel liquid sampling device. Vapor and liquid compositions and total vapor pressures of solutions of oxygen and nitrogen were measured along isotherms at 77.5[degrees], 70[degrees] and 65[degrees]K. The activity coefficients of nitrogen and oxygen may be represented by equations of the form [...] cal/cm^ mole has the values 1.22 at 77.5[degrees], 1.38 at 70[degrees] and 1.47 at 65[degrees]K. The deviations of the solutions from ideality are much less than is to be expected of regular solutions, in which the interaction energy between unlike molecules follows a geometric mean law. The data are not entirely consistent with the assumption that molar volumes are additive in the solutions. In an appendix a study of the vapor pressure of nitrogen is described.</abstract>
