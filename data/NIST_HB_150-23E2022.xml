    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150-23 presents the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Homeland Security Applications: Radiation Detection Instruments (RDI) program. It is intended for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2022 edition of NIST Handbook 150-23 incorporates changes resulting primarily to include reference to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards used for detection of illicit trafficking of radioactive materials. Also, the numbering of the handbook has also been restructured to reflect that is used by ISO/IEC17025:2017, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories, as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150, the interpretations and specific requirements in NIST Handbook 150-23, and the requirements in program-specific checklists (if applicable) must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP RDI program.
