    <abstract>This document provides a recommended practice for representing electronic component property data in accordance with ISO 10303-210:2014. It takes into account recent extensions to the EXPRESS schema in that standard and provides illustrations and examples of a typical use case of an integrated circuit amplifier. Example instance data is provided. Detailed examples are providing illustrating construction methodology for composing SI derived units commonly used in electronic component data sheets and catalogs. An example illustrating construction methodology for tabular data is provided. Several detailed examples have been generated demonstrating the population of a number of common characteristics using a variety of both SI base and derived units.</abstract>
