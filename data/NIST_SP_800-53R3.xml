    <abstract>The objective of NIST SP 800-53 is to provide a set of security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements levied on information systems and organizations and that is consistent with and complementary to other established information security standards. Revision 3 is the first major update since December 2005 and includes significant improvements to the security control catalog.</abstract>
