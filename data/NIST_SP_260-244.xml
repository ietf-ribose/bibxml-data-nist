    <abstract>Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 2246a Relative Intensity Correction Standard for Raman Spectroscopy: 830 nm Excitation is intended for use in the correction of the relative intensity of Raman spectra obtained with Raman instruments employing 830 nm laser excitation. A unit of SRM 2246a consists of an optical glass that emits a broad-band luminescence spectrum when excited with 830 nm laser radiation. The shape of the mean luminescence spectrum of this glass is described by a mathematical expression that relates the relative spectral intensity to the wavenumber (cm-1) expressed as the Raman shift from the 830 nm excitation laser wavelength. This model, together with a measurement of the luminescence spectrum of the standard, can be used to determine the spectral intensity response correction that is unique to each Raman system. The resulting instrument intensity response correction may then be used to obtain Raman spectra that are largely free from instrument-induced spectral artifacts. This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and computations involved in characterizing this product.</abstract>
