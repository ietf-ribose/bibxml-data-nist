    <abstract>Homeowners are increasingly interested in installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on the roof of their homes. There is a lack of publicly available tools to assist homeowners in making such an investment decision. The Applied Economic Office (AEO) in the Engineering Laboratory (EL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is addressing this need by developing a free, public web interface that provides independent economic analysis for a specific home based on a user s solar installation quote and electricity bill.</abstract>
