    <abstract>An account of the initial U.S. concerns with, and subsequent efforts to cope with, the safe use of ionizing radiation is given. National interest was focused in the National Bureau of Standards where radiation programs were established at the urging of, and with the close cooperation of, the radiological profession. The National Bureau of Standards' ionizing radiation research programs, the first in the U.S. Government, were dedicated to establishing a sound scientific base for x-ray measurement and protection. Along with the support and constant efforts of the national and international radiological organizations, the Bureau played a critially important role in the Nation's ability to use radiation effectively and safely. Based on widely scattered files assembled from both Government and non-government sources, this document represents a single source record of significant committee papers, correspondence, and decisions during the period 1913 to 1964, along with the author's summary of National Bureau of Standards' work, and the interrelated efforts of many others in the scientific community. A complete listing of the published output of the National Bureau of Standards' radiation staff is also included in this document. These papers contribute significantly to our understanding of ionizing radiation.</abstract>
