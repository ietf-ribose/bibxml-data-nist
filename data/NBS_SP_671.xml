    <abstract>This publication is written for those participating in the retroreflectance measurement assurance program (MAP) service provided by the National Bureau of Standards. This service is to verify the accuracy of measurement of coefficient of luminous intensity (R). This paper presents the techniques and procedures that are pertinent to participating in the MAP service, as well as a detailed explanation of the error analyses. Uncertainties for both retroreflectance and luminous transmittance were determined from two pilot studies carried out with the assistance of two industrial laboratories and by research performed on the elements of the MAP package.</abstract>
