    <abstract>This report presents the development of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the regional economy of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The general approach that this case study takes is outlined in Helgeson et al. [1] as a method to quantify the net co-benefits of investing in increased resilience, or the "resilience dividend." The current report provides the background on Cedar Rapids as a case study in planning for increased resilience and provides an overview of the CGE model of Cedar Rapids at two different time periods. This report is intended to provide context and background for future applications of the Cedar Rapids CGE model to quantify the resilience dividend.</abstract>
