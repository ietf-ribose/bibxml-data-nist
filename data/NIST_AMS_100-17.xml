    <abstract>In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes, the powder size characteristics, like particle shape, particle size (PS), particle size distribution (PSD), and the resulting powder bed density (PBD), are key influencing factors of the built material properties. To better understand the correlations between the powder size characteristics and the powder properties influencing the LPBF process, apparent density (AD), flowability, and PBD were measured corresponding to two commercial metal powders with different PS and PSD. The powder samples were taken from different locations on the build platform to also investigate the variations of these powder characteristics resulting from the spreading process by the stiff recoater blade. It was shown that the PS and PSD had a significant effect on the AD and the PBD. Powders with a wide PSD and with particle sizes in the range of the effective powder layer thickness, led to a higher PBD than powder with a high proportion of finer particles. No significant differences in PS and PSD were observed as powder was pushed across a build plate by the recoater blade.</abstract>
