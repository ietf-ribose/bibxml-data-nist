    <abstract>The IRis EXchange (IREX) program at NIST employs best measurement practices to support the development, standardization, and interoperability of iris-based technology through ongoing evaluations of that technology; IREX evaluations provide information that helps advance the development of a marketplace of iris-based applications based on standardized interoperable iris imagery and provides decision makers with information critical to their decisions about deployment of the technology. IREX has conducted a series of evaluations of iris algorithms which are documented on the IREX website at https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/iris-exchange-irex-overview. To assure that algorithms submitted for evaluation produce the same results in the NIST evaluation environment that they do in the developer/vendor environment, we need to compare results on a common set of iris images in the two environments. IREX-Validation-2019 is a dataset developed to facilitate such comparisons. In brief: The images in the dataset were collected under protocols approved by the NIST Institutional Review Board. The images are from subjects who provided model releases that permit use of the images in publications and datasets that are distributed by NIST. The dataset is distributed under user agreements associated with IREX evaluations. Inquiries regarding the IREX program may be directed to the IREX Liaison at irex@nist.gov. Any papers or reports making use of the dataset should cite this report as discussed in section 2.1 Carried out under NIST IRB Approved protocol ITL-16-0002.</abstract>
