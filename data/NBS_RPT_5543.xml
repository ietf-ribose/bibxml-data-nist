    <abstract>A large percentage of radio communication transmissions em¿̐¿ ploy binary amplitude or frequency modulation of the carrier, and the abrupt changes associated with binary modulation generate sideband components which frequently interfere with services in adjacent channels. By employing relatively simple filters in the keying circuits of linear AM or class C operated frequency-shift-keyed transmitters which smooth the transition from mark to space, it is possible to greatly reduce the amplitude of these interfering sidebands. The amount of amplitude reduction obtained is found by calculations and experimental measurements to be related to the attenuation characteristics of the low pass filter for both AM and FSK. Characteristics of desirable keying circuit filters to obtain these reductions are outlined. The minimum channel spacing required for a given ratio of undesired to desired carriers is shown to be determined by both the interfering frequency spectrum and the receiver selectivity characteristics. Methods of calculating the undesired output under both limiting conditions are described, and several typical examples are included.</abstract>
