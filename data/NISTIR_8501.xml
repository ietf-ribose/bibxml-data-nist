    <abstract>This report of the Semiconductors and Microelectronics Working Group of the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP) provides an overview of Federal government semiconductors and microelectronics standards activities and recommends standards focus areas and priorities for ICSP consideration. The Recommendations to the ICSP for Strategic Standards Priority Areas section of the report lists the current Standards Development Organizations in which the Federal government participates that are related to semiconductors and microelectronics, identifies five focus areas and priorities, and identifies gaps and opportunities for possible impacts in the future. The landscape review section provides an overview of each contributing agencyâ€™s relevant semiconductors and microelectronics standards activities, including its mission, semiconductors and microelectronics goals, participation in standards development organizations, semiconductors and microelectronics focus areas and priorities, and semiconductors and microelectronics gaps and opportunities. The National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology Strategy shows how the Semiconductors and Microelectronics Working Group aligns with the National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology.</abstract>
