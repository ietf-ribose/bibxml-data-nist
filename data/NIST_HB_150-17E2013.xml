    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150-17, NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing, presents the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) program. It is intended for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2013 edition incorporates the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version 1.2 requirements for testing. Amendments have been made to Annex E, SCAP testing, and the SCAP-related portions of the body text; the rest of the handbook is unchanged from the 2012 edition. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150, the interpretations and specific requirements in NIST Handbook 150-17 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP CST program.
