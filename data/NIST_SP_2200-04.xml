    <abstract>The NIST Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) presents its second issue of the 2023 NIST Annual Summary of U.S. Legal Metrology Activities report. This report includes a summary of changes made to NIST Handbook 44 (2023) Specifications, Tolerances and Other Technical Requirements for Commercial Weighing and Measuring Devices, NIST Handbook 130 (2023) Uniform Laws and Regulations in the Areas of Legal Metrology, and Fuel Quality, and NIST Handbook 133 (2023) Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods. The summary will provide an archival record of proposals and associated actions with the goal of assisting the weights and measures community in consistently interpreting and implementing NIST Handbooks 44, and 130. Each item in this report includes a NIST OWM technical analysis, background information, and a summary of any actions taken on proposed changes to these NIST Handbooks considered in 2023.</abstract>
