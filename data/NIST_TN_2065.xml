    <abstract>The room temperature elastic-plastic fracture toughness of additively manufactured (AM) Ti-6Al-4V was characterized by means of Elastic Compliance (EC) tests on Charpy-type fatigue precracked and side-grooved specimens. Various fabrication and material conditions were investigated: as-built parameters (effects of scan length and use of supports) and hot isostatic pressing parameters (effects of temperature and cooling rate). The results, although strictly not fully compliant with ASTM E1820-18ae1, can be considered representative of the fracture toughness of the material in the different conditions, and compare favorably with literature data for both non-AM and AM Ti-6Al-4V. Additional analyses were conducted with another single-specimen approach (Normalization Data Reduction) and were compared with EC results.</abstract>
