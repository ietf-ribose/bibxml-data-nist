    <abstract>In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity held a fingerprint data collection as part of the Nail to Nail Fingerprint Challenge. Participating Challengers deployed devices designed to collect an image of the full nail to nail surface area of a fingerprint - equivalent to a rolled fingerprint - from an unacclimated user without assistance from a trained device operator. Images captured from these devices were searched against a set of traditionally- captured operator-assisted rolled fingerprints. Thousands of latent fingerprints were also searched against the images.</abstract>
