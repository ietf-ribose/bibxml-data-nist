    <abstract>The goal of this paper is to understand how quality information characterizing the manufactured parts can be reported in a XML standardized format. The Quality Information Framework (QIF) is an ANSI standard sponsored by the Dimensional Metrology Standards Consortium (DMSC) that defines an integrated set of XML information models to enable the effective exchange of metrology data throughout the entire manufacturing quality measurement process - from product design to inspection planning to execution to analysis and reporting. The desire is that QIF will help foster a pervasive digital thread throughout the product lifecycle contributing to feedforward and feedback flow of quality information. The hope is that widespread adoption of QIF will lead to better and more optimized part design and manufacturing processes performance.</abstract>
