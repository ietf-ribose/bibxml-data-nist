    <abstract>The Department of Commerce (DOC) Boulder Laboratories (consisting of the National Institute for Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration); the DOC Office of Space Commerce; and the University of Colorado Boulder held a one-day Space Commerce Workshop on September 12, 2019. Members of industry, academia, and federal government organizations were brought together to identify key technology, measurement, and modeling barriers to deploying and safely operating commercial space technology. This workshop focused on technology barriers, solutions, and standards needed to foster conditions for economic growth and technical advancement of space industry. This document described key themes of the workshop and recommendations for overcoming the challenges of a continued increase in the number of government and commercial entities with industrially relevant objects in space.</abstract>
