    <abstract>On-road autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly influence key aspects of everyday life. However, these complex systems can pose a safety risk in the event of unexpected system performance. Therefore, NIST held the Standards and Performance Metrics for On-Road Autonomous Vehicles Workshop to solicit stakeholder feedback with respect to challenges and opportunities in developing standards and performance metrics for this complex interdisciplinary field. In addition, this workshop aimed to foster a community consisting of stakeholders from a variety of disciplines and domains in autonomous vehicles. This workshop was conducted virtually over 2 days (March 8th-9th, 2022) consisting of introductory remarks, panels, breakout sessions, and concluding remarks. This report is a summary of the technical topics discussed by participants during the workshop.</abstract>
