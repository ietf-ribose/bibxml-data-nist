    <abstract>Non-targeted analysis is the determination of the chemical composition of a complex mixture without a priori knowledge regarding the identities or quantities of the compound. These techniques can be performed in a wide variety of materials and areas of study. Methods and results between laboratories can vary widely based on the compounds of interest and user expertise, which can cause poor interlaboratory comparability of non-targeted results. To address this knowledge gap, three research grade test materials were developed to allow for the comparison of instrument methods, specifically reversed-phase liquid chromatography with positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The materials were shipped to thirty-one participating laboratories to be analyzed by their own non-targeted analysis instrumental method. Of the participants, twenty-three laboratories submitted good quality datasets and could be further evaluated. Using principal components analysis, the differences and similarities of the analytical methods could be examined. Overall, there were no obvious trends or associations between the methods of different laboratories and the review of the principal components analysis revealed no notable parameters that caused significant clustering or separation.</abstract>
