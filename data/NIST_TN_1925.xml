    <abstract>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and others are concerned about the hazard of acute carbon monoxide (CO) exposures from portable gasoline powered generators that can result in death or serious adverse health effects in exposed individuals. As of May 15, 2015, the CPSC databases contain records of at least 702 deaths (involving 523 incidents) from CO poisoning in the U.S. caused by consumer use of a generator in the period of 2004 through 2014 (Hnatov 2015). There were an additional 49 CO poisoning deaths (involving 39 incidents) associated with consumer use of both a generator and at least one other CO-producing consumer appliance, for a total of 751 CO poisoning deaths (involving 562 incidents) associated with generators for the same 11-year period. The majority of these deaths occurred when consumers used a generator in an enclosed or partially enclosed space or outdoors near an open door, window or vent. While avoiding the operation of such generators in or near an enclosed space is expected to reduce indoor CO exposures significantly, it may not be realistic to expect such usage to be eliminated completely. Another means of reducing these exposures would be to decrease the rate at which CO is emitted from these devices. A computer simulation study was conducted to provide CPSC staff with information to support comparisons of modeled residential CO exposures reflecting operation of current designs of portable engine-driven electric generators, inside homes or in attached garages. These results were compared to simulated operation of reduced emission generators meeting a potential CO emission rate limit performance requirement being considered by CPSC staff under portable generator rulemaking activities. These simulations employed the multizone airflow and contaminant transport model CONTAM, which was applied to a set of 40 buildings (consisting of 37 houses and 3 detached garages, considered broadly representative of fatal CO poisoning incidents reported in CPSC databases) that are primarily based on a collection of models representative of the U.S. housing stock. This report presents sample CO and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) simulation results for three of the houses and one of the garages modeled. The results presented demonstrate that generators with the reduced CO emission rates result in peak CO concentrations that can be reduced by 40 % to more than 90 % depending on the specific case being analyzed. The reduced CO emission rates also result in significant reductions in COHb in many cases. Additionally, use of a thermal building model coupled with the airflow and IAQ model to properly account for thermal effects was shown to be important as the interaction of the generators heat generation and the ambient weather conditions can significantly impact both air change rates and interzone airflow patterns in the buildings.</abstract>
