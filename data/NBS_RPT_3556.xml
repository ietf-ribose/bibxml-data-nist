    <abstract>The propagation factors which affect the coverage volume of a TACAN type facility operating in the 1000 Me region are discussed in this paper. Using theoretical and empirical methods, prediction curves are derived which indicate the probability of receiving satisfactory service in a given volume of air space. Equipment capabilities and interfering co-channel facilities are considered. The coverage volume free from interference is a function of the distance separating co-channel facilities and various spacings are considered, depending on the type of service which a facility might be expected to render. Included are some of the effects which can be expected from various ground antenna heights, particularly on the interference free coverage volume and on the vertical lobe structure. A number of other factors relating to the ground equipment siting are also discussed.</abstract>
