    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed to measure the performance impact of cybersecurity technologies on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The testbed was chosen to support the implementation of the Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile: a voluntary, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity activities and reducing cyber risk to manufacturing systems. This report focuses on the Collaborative Robotics System, one of the two manufacturing systems within the testbed. A methodology for implementation of technical solutions to meet the Profile language is described, as well as a comprehensive review of the testbed measurement systems, and the comparative analysis procedures used for identifying performance impacts. Finally, an example comparative analysis is performed and the characterization of the workcell is discussed.</abstract>
