    <abstract>The metrological term quantity value in various forms has conflicting interpretations. Standardization of the vocabulary of metrology has not ended the confusion. This report provides a historical trace of how the inconsistency arose and then describes how it has hindered international standards work, eroded conceptual integrity, and made the communication of software design concepts more difficult.</abstract>
