    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat -soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Winter, Spring and Fall 1989 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin XV Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum, 2) Round Robin XVI FatSoluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum, and 3) Round Robin XVII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum. The materials for Round Robin XV were shipped to participants in January 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results by February 6, 1989. The materials for Round Robin XVI were shipped to participants in April 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results by May 15, 1989. The materials for Round Robin XVII were shipped to participants in August 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results by October 1, 1989.</abstract>
