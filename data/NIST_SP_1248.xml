    <abstract>The Public Safety Communications Research Division (PSCR) at NIST plays a primary role in research and development to impact public safety operational capabilities. PSCR's mission is to bring advanced capabilities to first responders and have a measurable impact on their ability to protect and save lives and property. This report details the impacts of PSCR's intramural and extramural programs across five leading indicators: Increasing Research Capacity, Disruptive Approaches and Technology, Standards, Products, and Public Safety Methods. As the PSCR program enters its final three years of allocated funding under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, it aims to increase its dynamic impact on the development of standards, methodologies, and technologies that will make the next generation nationwide public safety broadband network a reality. PSCR will continue to document and report on the outcomes of its diverse research to ensure that technical advancements supported by the program are made available for all stakeholders to maximize the operational effectiveness of first responders.</abstract>
