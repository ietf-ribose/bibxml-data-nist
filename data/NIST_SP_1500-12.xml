    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the Time Distribution Alternatives for the Smart Grid Workshop at its Gaithersburg, Maryland Campus on March 21, 2017. The event, co-hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, brought together experts from industry, government, national laboratories, and academia to determine research and development (R) priorities for alternatives to global positioning system (GPS) time distribution in electrical power systems. The information gained will inform future NIST, DOE, national laboratories and private sector technical programs and strategic planning. The workshop also served to drive discussion for the North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) working group meeting held following the workshop.</abstract>
