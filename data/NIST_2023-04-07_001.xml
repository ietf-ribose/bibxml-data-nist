    <abstract>In response to the work-related fatality at the National Fire Research Laboratory on September 26, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a planned, two-step process to understand the causes of the incident and identify actions necessary to prevent future incidents. Incident investigation and development of an incident corrective action plan. The investigation was conducted by staff from the NIST Office of Safety, Health, and Environment and the NIST Engineering Laboratory. The focus was on identifying the causal factors, root causes, and contributing factors of the specific incident. Corrective actions were developed to address the deficiencies identified, as well as other recommendations for NIST leadership to consider. The results of this effort are presented in Part A of this document. Executive Team review and development of a NIST-level corrective action plan. Subsequently, a subcommittee of NISTâ€™s Executive Safety Committee assessed the report and considered the NIST-wide applicability of the corrective actions identified. The Executive Review Team extended corrective actions and recommendations, as necessary, to ensure sufficient breadth, depth, and sustainability of these actions across NIST. Their work is included in Part B of this report. Through these two activities, NIST shall strengthen its safety management system and address existing shortcomings in its safety culture to protect the safety and health of all staff.</abstract>
