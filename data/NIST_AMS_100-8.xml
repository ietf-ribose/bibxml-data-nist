    <abstract>This report summarizes the results from the OAGi/NIST workshop Drilling down on Smart Manufacturing -- Enabling Composable Apps, which was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology campus in Gaithersburg, MD, on April 18-19, 2016. The purpose of the workshop was to identify and discuss challenges in advancing the vision of composable manufacturing systems within the context of open cloud service platforms for Smart Manufacturing systems. The report describes (1) the idea of composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing systems as a basis for achieving easily assembled and re-configured Smart Manufacturing systems, (2) the results of five breakout sessions, and (3) the key findings from the workshop as well as the next steps planned for the workshop series. The breakout session descriptions provide an overview of respective R areas, their goals, capability gaps, proposed technology characteristics, and priority working items.</abstract>
