    <abstract>This document is intended to be a practical guide used by engineers and managers facilitating them to go through the process of defining the objectives of their wireless systems and examining the environments where the wireless systems are to be deployed, then helping them in selecting, designing, deploying, and monitoring the wireless systems using existing technology in a factory. Sufficient background materials about wireless technologies are provided, so that the users have some basic understanding of wireless systems being addressed. Thus the document is aimed to be a light-weighted, easy-to-use, reference guide, equipped with checklists throughout the lifecycle of wireless technology from concept and design to deployment and monitoring.</abstract>
