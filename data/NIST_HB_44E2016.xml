    <abstract>Handbook 44 was first printed in 1949, having been preceded by similar handbooks of various designations and in several forms. This 2016 edition was developed by the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with the assistance of the Office of Weights and Measures of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The handbook includes amendments adopted by the 100th Annual Meeting of the NCWM in 2015. NIST Handbook 44 is published in its entirety each year following the NCWM Annual Meeting.</abstract>
