    <abstract>A small sample of powder was dropped in a specified manner from a dispenser at the top of an enclosure. The reflectance of the powder distribution at the bottom of the enclosure was measured with respect to a layer of the same powder in a specified form. One hundred times the reflectance measured in this way was the measure of dispersibility, The dispersibility of powdered sodium bicarbonate was studied as a function of particle size and the dispersibility was found to be a maximum for powder with a mean particle diameter of 15 microns.</abstract>
