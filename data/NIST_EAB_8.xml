    <abstract>This analysis is an attempt to quantify the number and type of interactions between NIST and the U.S. economy from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014. These interactions of diverse types include those between NIST and other government entities, academic institutions, and private businesses. Together they demonstrate the true size of the organizations' scientific footprint.</abstract>
