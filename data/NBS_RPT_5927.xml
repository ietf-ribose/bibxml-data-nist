    <abstract>Transient temperature distribution histories, thermal stresses, and deflections were computed for 13 box beams uniformly heated along one cover. Various heating rates, geometries of beam cross-section, and thermal properties were considered. Heat transfer was by radiation and conduction. Gaseous heat transfer and possible effects of yielding, creep, and buckling were neglected. For maximum beam temperatures above 700-900¿̐¿ F, change in emissivity of the interior surfaces of the beam had an appreciable effect on the cover (but not the web) temperatures and, to an even greater extent, on the beam deflection. At maximum beam temperatures of 1200¿̐¿ F, an increase in interior surface emissivity caused an appreciable decrease of the maximum thermal stress. A rough experimental check of temperature distri¿̐¿ bution and beam deflection was made for one case.</abstract>
