    <abstract>This report updates and extends NIST Interagency Report 8238, documenting performance of new face recognition algorithms submitted for evaluation to NIST in November 2018. The algorithms implement one-to-many identification of faces appearing in two- dimensional images. Three datasets were used - the primary dataset is comprised of 26.6 mil- lion reasonably well-controlled live portrait photos of 12.3 million individuals. Three smaller datasets containing more unconstrained photos are also used: 200 thousand side-view images; 3.2 million webcam images; 2.5 million photojournalism and amateur photographer photos. The report will be useful for comparison of face recognition algorithms and assessment of absolute capability. There is an additional appendix to this NISTIR, which contains individual reporting for each algorithm submitted to FRVT 1:N. These report cards are available at: https://nfiles.nist.gov/w/dEmFbwW2</abstract>
