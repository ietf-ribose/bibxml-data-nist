    <abstract>This report serves to characterize the uncertainty of measurements for key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the physical and network performance of the NIST industrial wireless dual-lift testbed. A review of the methods used to determine uncertainty is presented. We use the method known as the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) to calculate the uncertainty values for each measurement. A description of the dual-lift use case and the KPIs are presented. The resulting expanded uncertainty values are calculated for the KPIs, which are the positional Cartesian error between the leader and follower robots, and the latency of the data packets associated with the informational transactions of the leader and followerâ€™s control loop. It is concluded that the measurement systems used in the dual-lift use case have relatively small uncertainty values for the detection of latency perturbations in the real-time control application implemented on the testbed.</abstract>
