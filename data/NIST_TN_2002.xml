    <abstract>In April 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) held a dry run for the data collection portion of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge. This data collection event was designed to ensure that the real data collection event held in September 2017 would be successful. To this end, real biometric data from unhabituated individuals needed to be collected. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of IARPA, has released a dataset of the biometric images obtained during the N2N Fingerprint Challenge dry run data collection. The image distribution, entitled Special Database 301 (SD 301), can be freely downloaded from the NIST website.</abstract>
