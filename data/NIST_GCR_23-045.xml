    <abstract>In September 2022, the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Engineers commenced a project under National Institute of Standards and Technology Contract No.1333ND22PNB730391 to develop workshops on Advancement in Computational Wind Engineering and Advancement in Performance-Based Wind Design. This report documents the results of the workshop on Advancement in Performance-Based Wind Design. The workshop and subsequent roadmap for the standardization and application of performance-based wind design is to be developed by wind engineering practitioners and researchers for buildings.</abstract>
