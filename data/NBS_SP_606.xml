    <abstract>Standard installation practices were developed to assistin assuring the effectiveness and safety of energy conservation measures installed under the Residential Conservation Service (RCS). They serve as mandatory standards under RCS but are recommended guides for all installations of the covered materials and products. The criteria are being used by DoE to develop training manuals for installers, inspectors, and energy auditors. Part I provides information on the intended use of the practices, outlines the RCS program, and discusses specific major technical and related issues that were considered in the development of the standards: moisture and building retrofit, attic ventilation, electrical wiring, recessed and surface-mounted fixtures, the use of diagnostic tools (infrared thermography, air change rate, and window air leakage measurements), and product certification. Part II provides the actual practices together with commentary and additional recommendations.</abstract>
