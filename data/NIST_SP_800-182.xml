    <abstract>Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, requires NIST to prepare an annual public report on activities undertaken in the previous year, and planned for the coming year, to carry out responsibilities under this law. The primary goal of the Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of NIST s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), is to provide standards and technology that protects information systems against threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and services. During Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015), CSD successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission. Through CSD's diverse research agenda and engagement in many national priority initiatives, high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed and applied that improved information security across the federal government and the greater information security community. This annual report highlights the research agenda and activities in which CSD was engaged during FY 2015.</abstract>
