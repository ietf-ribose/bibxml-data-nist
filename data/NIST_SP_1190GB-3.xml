    <abstract>Once a community identifies its resilience gaps, the challenge shifts to identifying solutions to close those gaps. One of the most helpful actions is to research and understand what other communities have done to accomplish their goals. This Guide Brief offers descriptions of and links to community resilience programs of leading U.S. communities that follow the process in the Guide or have common goals to those of the Guide. These examples may assist the community resilience planning team in developing practical solutions and implementation plans in Step 4.</abstract>
