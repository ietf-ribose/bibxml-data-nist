    <abstract>This document, 'Guide for Labeling Consumer Packages by Weight, Volume, Count, or Measure (length, area, or thickness),'' is based on the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation (UPLR) in National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 130, 'Uniform Laws and Regulation in the Areas of Legal Metrology and Fuel Quality.'' It provides a summary of labeling requirements for consumer products and commodities sold by weight, volume, count, or measure. This guide is not a replacement for the UPLR. The reader should refer to the UPLR to ensure that all requirements are met. This guide does not apply to wine, malted beverages and distilled spirits, some packages of meat and poultry products subject to the label requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and to packages labeled for export.</abstract>
