    <abstract>Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked, digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. The growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics. Opportunities exist with Big Data to address the volume, velocity and variety of data through new scalable architectures. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important, fundamental concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework (NBDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 1, contains a definition of Big Data and related terms necessary to lay the groundwork for discussions surrounding Big Data.</abstract>
