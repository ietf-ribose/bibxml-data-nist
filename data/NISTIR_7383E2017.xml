    <abstract>This publication contains Good Measurement Procedures (GMP), Good Laboratory Procedures (GLP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for use in calibration laboratories performing volumetric calibrations. This edition is updated from the 2013 version with minor updates to SOPs 14, 18, 19, 26 to explicitly calculate and report the mean volume and enter values from Run 1 and Run 2 into standard deviation charts; SOP 21 (revised March 2017) to remove the neck calibration procedure and refine the measurement process. The SOP 21 revision also includes calculations and corrections for the volume at 60 [degrees] F and 100 psig in one step instead of two and to explicitly calculate and report the mean volume and enter values from Run 1 and Run 2 into standard deviation charts. SOP 31 is a new procedure used for neck calibrations of provers and test measures.</abstract>
