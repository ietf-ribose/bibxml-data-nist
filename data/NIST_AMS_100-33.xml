    <abstract>A two-day workshop was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD on December 2 - 3, 2019 on the subject of defining and prioritizing standards needed for 3-dimensional robotic perception systems for part localization, part recognition, part capture, and complex assembly. The event had 28 attendees, including 10 NIST personnel. The work seeks to benefit both vendors and users in the 3D perception industry through the development of new standards for a variety of use cases. Key results from the workshop were: 1) a ranked list of 39 standards needed, 2) six of the highest ranked standards were developed into ASTM work items, and 3) several of the attendees from industry agreed to champion some of the six work items. This document is a report on the various presentations, activities, decisions, and interactions that happened during and prior to the workshop.</abstract>
