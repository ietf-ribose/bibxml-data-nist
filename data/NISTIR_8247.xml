    <abstract>There is a need to establish well-defined, public safety scenarios for the evaluation of current and future communication technologies for first responders. The scenario descriptions must contain enough details to be considered representative of key public safety operations and their communications needs. The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for developing these so-called 'public safety scenarios'.</abstract>
