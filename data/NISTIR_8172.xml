    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted research to define and recommend an interoperable data solution to assist law enforcement in acquiring and analyzing digital video evidence from disparate systems. This document supplements the recommendation developed in NISTIR 8161. Recommendation: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Digital Video Export Profile Level 0. This supplement describes the research activities, methods, and results that led to the recommended standards profile. It also provides web links to the sample files used to conduct the research and validate implementation of the recommendation. NIST welcomes and seeks continued industry and other stakeholder comments concerning the initial (Level 0) recommendation and potential future enhancements. NIST looks forward to identifying and working with the pertinent standards community to move the recommendation into a formal standard that becomes adopted widely by industry.</abstract>
