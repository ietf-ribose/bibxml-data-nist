    <abstract>Under the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is assigned 'primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems.' [EISA Title XIII, Section 1305]. There is an urgent need to establish these standards. Recognizing the urgency, NIST developed a three-phase plan to accelerate the identification of standards while establishing a robust framework for the longer-term evolution of the standards and establishment of testing and certification procedures. This report is the output of Phase 1. It describes a high-level reference model for the Smart Grid, identifies nearly 80 existing standards that can be used now to support Smart Grid development, identifies 14 high priority gaps, plus cyber security, for which new or revised standards are needed, documents action plans with aggressive timelines by which designated Standards Development Organizations are tasked to fill these gaps, and describes the strategy being pursued to establish standards for ensuring cyber security of the Smart Grid.</abstract>
