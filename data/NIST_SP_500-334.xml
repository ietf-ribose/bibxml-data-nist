    <abstract>While contactless fingerprint capture devices stand to provide for many benefits, images from this nascent technology are sufficiently different than traditional contact-collected images thereby warranting the separation of these new contactless fingerprint images from legacy contact-collected images and systems operating on them. This Best Practices Recommendation defines voluntary (informative) changes to the ANSI/NIST standard to allow for the creation of contactless transactions that are not readily ingestible by existing systems, but based closely on ANSI/NIST so that minimal changes to the system can allow for processing. Furthermore, the transactions can include the original sensor data, in addition to the contact-compatible/interoperable image in the event that vendors improve their technologies and allow for the reprocessing of the data without recapturing.</abstract>
