    <abstract>The report summarizes NBS research in the area of walkway and shoe slip-resistance measurement since 1924 and outlines current activities that will provide a technical basis for slip-resistance measurement. Current activities in data base development and identification of standard reference surfaces contribute to a rational basis for quantitative slip-resistance criteria for building codes and standards. Proposed future research thrusts include personal factors such as human biokinetic and perceptual variables, as well as environmental factors such as lighting in the built environment. The research will contribute to the development of new intervention strategies to reduce deaths and injuries due to slips and falls.</abstract>
