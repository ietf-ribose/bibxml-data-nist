    <abstract>The document presents information on 132 private sector groups in the United States which engage in product certification activities. Entries describe the type and purpose of each organization, the nature of the activity, products certified, standards used, certification requirements, any accreditation or recognition by a U.S. or foreign private sector or government agency, availability of services, methods of cost determination, and other relevant details. The directory is part of an ongoing NIST (formerly NBS) effort to establish and maintain comprehensive information on standards, regulations, certification programs and related topics.</abstract>
