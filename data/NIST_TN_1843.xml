    <abstract>Polymer and other coatings are commonly used to protect, enhance or decorate wood, plastic and metal products used in homes and other buildings. Nanoparticles (i.e., particles having at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm) are increasingly being added to coating formulations to reduce damage as well as to enhance their performance. Because of their small size and large surface area, nanomaterials may exhibit unique physical, chemical and transport behaviors in the environment and in the human body. Research in recent years has indicated that nanoparticles may be potentially harmful to the environment and to human health. In order to better understand human exposure associated with the airborne release of such particles, material specimens with coatings containing nanoparticles were tested in a small environmental chamber in which coated materials were subjected to surface abrasion intended to simulate normal wear and tear. This report describes the experimental approach and the results obtained, which showed minimal airborne release of the nanoparticles in the tested coatings.</abstract>
