    <abstract>This Guide Brief provides an example of how to determine the anticipated performance of water and wastewater systems subjected to an earthquake and tsunami event. The methodology used for this can be applied to all infrastructure systems. The example demonstrates the information required to complete the performance goals tables and establish the existing system performance that needs to be completed for building clusters and supporting infrastructure systems. This Guide Brief is intended to be read following an introduction to the topic in Guide Brief 29, Determine Anticipated Performance. It can also applied with Section 16 in Volume II of the Guide.</abstract>
