    <abstract>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 80000, the International System of Quantities, collects and organizes the most important physical quantities into a coherent system. In a similar fashion, this report collects and organizes the most important quantities used in software metrics, focusing on software as a product rather than its development process.</abstract>
