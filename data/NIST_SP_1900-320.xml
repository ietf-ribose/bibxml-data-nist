    <abstract>2 A workshop on Consensus Safety Measurement Methodologies for Automated Driving System (ADS) - 3 Equipped Vehicles was held at NIST 25-26 June 2019 on the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus, 4 sponsored by NIST and the U.S. Department of Transportation and partners Intel, Intel Mobileye, Lyft, 5 Ricardo, SAE International, and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. It was attended by over 110 6 leaders from local, state and federal government; manufacturing and technology industry; and 7 academia. 8 9 The workshop consisted of keynotes, panel presentations and breakout sessions, addressing the topic 10 from the State and Users, Developers, Standards and Testing, Methods and Frameworks and Innovation 11 perspectives. The scope of this workshop and this report is an assessment of the need for measurement 12 methodologies for ADS-equipped vehicle safety. This document reports on the views expressed by the 13 participants in these sessions and summarizes the input on the steps that can accelerate progress 14 toward safe and trusted Automated Driving System (ADS)-equipped vehicles.</abstract>
