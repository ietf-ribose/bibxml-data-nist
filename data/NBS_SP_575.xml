    <abstract>The wall chart 'Design for Better Window Performance' describes window and other design elements and the impact of these design elements singly and in combination on window performance and building attributes. The design elements are grouped into four categories: Exterior-windbreaks, shades, coverings and sun orientation; Frame-insulating frame, opening type, weather strip and hardware; Glazing-multi-glazing, reflective glazing, plastic glazing and glass block; Interior-interior shading, interior coverings, integral lighting and interior mass. The impacts of these design elements are describes in a matrix form and address the following window and building attributes: Airtightness, Water tightness, Natural ventilation, Insulation, Solar admittance, Daylighting, Visual separation, Acoustical isolation, Safety, Access/Egress, Ease of operation, Forced entry resistance, and Durability/Maintenance. The chart is designed for ready reference during the design process.</abstract>
