    <abstract>In this report transmission loss data in the 7 50-900 Mc/s range from three long knife-edge diffraction paths (in Colorado, Alaska, and Europe) are evaluated and analyzed in terms of power fading (long-term variability) and short-term variability represented by prolonged space-wave fadeouts. A comparison is made of calculated and measured cumulative distributions of hourly median transmission loss values. It appears that long-term variability over a knife-edge diffraction path can be estimated by convoluting the distributions of hourly medians for the two component line-of-sight paths, and that short-term variations represented by space-wave fadeouts are more prevalent when substantial phase interference due to ground reflections in the vicinity of the terminal is likely to exist.</abstract>
