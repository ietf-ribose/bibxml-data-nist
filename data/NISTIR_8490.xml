    <abstract>Computer-interpretable representations of system structure and behavior are at the center of developing todayâ€™s complex systems. Systems engineers create and review these representations using graphical languages and information models that capture requirements, designs, and tests (such as the Systems Modeling Language, SysML). The SysML Extension for Physical Interaction and Signal Flow Simulation (SysPhS) is a standard for augmenting SysML models with one-dimensional (lumped parameter) simulation information and translating them to widely-used simulation platforms for testing, without respecifying the system on those platforms. It includes standard reusable models of system components (libraries) corresponding and translated to those in common between the platforms. This report presents additional physical interaction component libraries, covering areas not currently standardized. It applies the libraries to some manufacturing examples, translates them to the simulation platforms, and verifies that they give the same results across platforms.</abstract>
