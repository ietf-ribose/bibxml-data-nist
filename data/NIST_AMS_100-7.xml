    <abstract>The Symposium on Data Analytics for Advanced Manufacturing was held in conjunction with the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data in Washington D.C. on December 6-7, 2016. The Symposium's goal was to address manufacturing industries' issues, needs, and challenges related to data analytics solutions for advanced manufacturing. The Symposium was themed From Sensing to Decision-Making. The Symposium brought industry, government, and academic organizations together to exchange ideas and provide a common platform to build partnerships. This report summarizes the keynote presentations, technical paper presentations, and panel discussion of this symposium. The Symposium also hosted a manufacturing data challenge, which is summarized in this report. This report also elicits the lessons learned from this symposium, and presents action items for future research on data analytics for advanced manufacturing.</abstract>
