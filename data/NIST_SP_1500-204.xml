    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a Technical Workshop on January 27 and 28, 2021 to assess the state and challenges of a Circular Economy (CE) in the High-Tech World. Scientists, researchers, and program managers in the CE arena, from industry, academia, government, national laboratories, and non-governmental organizations gathered virtually to identify challenges and key priorities to facilitate the reuse, repair, and recycling of electronic products, solar panels, and batteries. The results of the workshop provide important input for program planning and research directions that can advance materials design, use, reuse, and recovery, thus enhancing circularity.</abstract>
