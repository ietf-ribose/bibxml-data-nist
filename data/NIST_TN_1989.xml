    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinated an interlaboratory study for laboratories that use photoacoustic spectroscopy to measure and report aerosol absorption. This report describes the design and results for the NIST Interlaboratory Study of Aerosol Absorption Measurements using Photoacoustic Spectroscopy from twelve participating laboratories using a material that was characterized and distributed by NIST on June 12, 2017. Participants were requested to provide measurement results by August 30, 2017. The participating laboratories reported 4,569 aerosol absorption cross sections as a function of particle size, particle mass and wavelength.</abstract>
