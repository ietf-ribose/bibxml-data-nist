    <abstract>This Guide Brief aims to assist the collaborative planning team with Step 4, Plan Development, by supporting communities in identifying resilience gaps using the performance goals tables. These performance goals focus on system function rather than individual component performance. The document discusses approaches to prioritize actions that address those gaps and/or mitigation measures to close those gaps. Both are essential aspects of developing an overall resilience plan.</abstract>
