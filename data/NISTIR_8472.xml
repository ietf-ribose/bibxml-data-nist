    <abstract>Non-fungible token (NFT) technology provides a mechanism to enable real assets (both virtual and physical) to be sold and exchanged on a blockchain. While NFTs are most often used for autographing digital assets (associating oneâ€™s name with a digital object), they utilize a strong cryptographic foundation that may enable them to regularly support ownership-transferring sales of digital and physical objects. For this, NFT implementations need to address potential security concerns to reduce the risk to purchasers. This publication explains NFT technology and then identifies and discusses a list of 27 potential security issues. All of the identified issues can be addressed through use of a systematic security approach that promotes a secure design and implementation.</abstract>
