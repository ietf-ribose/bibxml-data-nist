    <abstract>Computer viruses continue to pose a threat to the integrity and availability of computer systems. This is especially true for users of personal computers. A variety of anti-virus tools are now available to help manage this threat. These tools use a wide range of techniques to detect, identify, and remove viruses. This guide provides criteria for judging the functionality, practicality, and convenience of anti-virus tools. It furnishes information which readers can use to determine which tools are best suited to target environments, but it does not weigh the merits of specific tools.</abstract>
