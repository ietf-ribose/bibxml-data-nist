    <abstract>The objective of this project was to study and make recommendations concerning the utilization of high-strength steel reinforcing bars in concrete structures subjected to earthquake ground motion. This work grew out of the ATC-57 report, The Missing Piece: Improving Seismic Design and Construction Practices (ATC, 2003), which defines a roadmap for the NIST problem-focused research and development program in earthquake engineering. The ATC-57 report recommended that NIST examine new technologies that can improve construction productivity, such as high-strength reinforcement.</abstract>
