    <abstract>Standard Reference Material (SRM) 917d D-Glucose (Dextrose) is certified as a chemical substance of known high purity. It is intended for use in calibrating measuring systems for glucose determinations employed in clinical analysis. A unit of SRM 917d consists of one bottle containing 50 g of crystalline D-glucose. This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and computations involved in characterizing this product.</abstract>
