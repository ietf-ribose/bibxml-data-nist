    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the ASME Standards Subcommittee Meeting on Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Prognostics for Manufacturing Operations on May 22-23, 2019, at the NIST Gaithersburg (Maryland) campus. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss progress and future needs, and to prioritize work activities for standards and guidelines related to advanced monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies (also identified as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)) for enhancing manufacturing maintenance and control strategies. This report documents the results of the meeting, including priority topics for standards and guidelines. The next steps in this effort are presented towards the end of this document, including planning for future standards events, subcommittee meetings, and white paper publication of one of the priority topics.</abstract>
