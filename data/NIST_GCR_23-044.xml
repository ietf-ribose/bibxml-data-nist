    <abstract>The purpose of this impact assessment is to provide stakeholders with relevant information about how the PSCR program spent Public Safety Trust Funds and the results of that funding. This report seeks to demonstrate the value and positive outcomes of a one-time injection of funds into a topic area and the extent to which this model can be repeated in other areas of significant impact, such as semiconductor research and manufacturing programs or incentivizing research in the cause and effects of climate change.</abstract>
