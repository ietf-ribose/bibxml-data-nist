    <abstract>NIST has constructed a Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility that will be used as a testbed for investigating the measurement science related to systems, components, and operations that will lead to homes that generate as much energy over a course of a year through onsite renewable means as is consumed within the facility. The facility contains hundreds of sensors that are used to monitor the overall performance of the home along with its major systems: heating and cooling, electrical, ventilation, hot water, lighting, and photovoltaics. Additionally, approaches have been implemented to monitor the indoor thermal conditions, indoor air quality, and outdoor conditions. This document describes the monitoring approaches implemented in the facility to enable accurate measures of the performance of the systems within the facility and the resulting indoor environmental quality.</abstract>
