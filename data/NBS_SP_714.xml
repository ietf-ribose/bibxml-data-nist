    <abstract>The directory presents information on 61 U.S. Government certification programs for products and services. Entries describe the scope and nature of each certification program, testing and inspection practices, standards used, methods of identification and enforcement, reciprocal recognition or acceptance of certification, and other relevant details. The directory is part of an ongoing NBS effort to establish and maintain a comprehensive database on standards, regulations, certification programs and related information. The material has been compiled to meet the needs of government, industry, and the public for information on U.S. Government certification programs in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Trade Agreements Act of 1979.</abstract>
