    <abstract>In this work, we compiled and evaluated both self-diffusion and binary-diffusion coefficients D for gases as a function of temperature. The tables in this paper have approximately 300 individual diffusion coefficients for a wide range of chemical classes: rare gases, small H/O/N/S species, hydrocarbons, and oxygen-, nitrogen-, and halogen-substituted hydrocarbons. The recommended values for the diffusion coefficients are for standard room temperature 298.15 K (D298) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa). We also provide expressions for many of the diffusion coefficients as a function of temperature, where available in the literature.</abstract>
