    <abstract>Four large bulkhead intersection specimens were tested in tension in the Engineering Mechanics Section of the National Bureau of Standards for the Ship Structure Committee The tests are part of a study of the typical structural discontinuities in ships to determine the magnitude of stress concentrations and areas affected by discontinuities, and to furnish data necessary for improving current designs. Each specimen represents the intersection of a longitudinal bulkhead and a transverse bulkhead as found in welded tanker design. The elastic stress distribution at room temperature, strain distribution prior to failure at 0¿̐¿F, and energy for failure at 0¿̐¿F are presented. Stress values in the region of the intersection are compared with stresses in the longitudinal bulkhead bordering the intersection. Stress concentrations and energy at failure for the different specimens are also compared.</abstract>
