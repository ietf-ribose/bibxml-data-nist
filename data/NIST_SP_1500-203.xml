    <abstract>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) comprise interacting digital, analog, physical, and human components engineered for function through integrated physics and logic. NIST established the CPS Public Working Group (CPS PWG) to bring together a broad range of CPS experts in an open public forum to help define and shape key characteristics of CPS, to better manage development and implementation within and across multiple smart application domains, including smart manufacturing, transportation, energy, and healthcare. The resulting CPS Framework provides an organized presentation of a CPS analysis methodology based on the CPS Framework core concepts of facets (modes of the system engineering process: conceptualization, realization and assurance) and aspects (clusters of concerns: functional, business, human, trustworthiness, timing, data, composition, boundaries, and lifecycle). This volume contains additional material on timing in cyber-physical systems produced by the timing subgroup, which supplements information in NIST SP 1500-202.</abstract>
