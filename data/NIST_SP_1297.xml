    <abstract>Welcome to the SI Units Card Deck! This interactive educational activity offers a fun way for students to enhance their understanding of the International System of Units (SI), including the Defining Constants, Base Units, Derived Units with Special Names, and Prefixes. Play activities like those in this activity, are an easy way to motivate students to learn, build self-confidence and transfer SI measurement skills to other situations. Familiarity with the elements and structure the SI prepare students to successfully make measurements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) applications. With multiple game variations, games may be differentiated for multiple instructional and skill levels. The deck consists of 9 sets (142 cards), game instructions, game template, and supplemental resources.</abstract>
