    <abstract>This study was conducted by the National Institute of Building Sciences Building Seismic Safety Council (BSSC). The goal was to develop standardized categories for older concrete buildings that incorporate more detail than those included in the standard set of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Concrete Model Building Types, namely, C1-frames, C2-shear walls, C3-concrete frames with masonry infill, and PC2-precast frames. The recommended subtypes generally can be identified without extensive engineering evaluation and therefore can document the inventory of older concrete buildings in an effort to better quantify how many structures might require mitigation. The identification of these subtypes also contributes to determination of the highest priority research needed to enable rapid implementation of performance-based seismic design for mitigation.</abstract>
