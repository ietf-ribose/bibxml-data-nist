    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150-2, 2016 edition, presents the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Calibration Laboratories Program. The 2016 edition of NIST Handbook 150-2 supersedes and replaces the following handbooks: 150-2A:2004, 150-2B:2004, 150-2C:2001, 150-2D:2004, 150-2E:2001, 150-2F:2003, 150-2G:2004, and 150-2H:2004. The 2016 edition consolidates several technical guidance documents in the NIST Handbook 150-2 series into one document with a set of normative annexes, including: Annex A which addresses the general accreditation requirements prescribed in ANSI/NCSL Z540-1-1994, Calibration Laboratories and Measuring and Test Equipment General Requirements, Part I, that are not directly addressed in ISO/IEC 17025:2005; Annex B which sets out technical requirements not covered in NIST Handbook 150 that are applicable to a laboratory recognized as competent to carry out dimensional calibrations; Annex C which sets out technical requirements not covered in NIST Handbook 150 that are applicable to a laboratory recognized as competent to carry out time and frequency calibrations. Additional annexes covering the remaining fields of calibration will be published upon the completion of their review and updating. The annexes form a normative part of this handbook, meaning they contain provisions that laboratories must meet in order to conform to the requirements for accreditation. Calibration laboratories use NIST Handbook 150-2 in developing the management and technical systems that govern their operations. Laboratory customers, regulatory authorities, and accreditation bodies may also use it as a basis upon which to judge the competence of laboratories.</abstract>
