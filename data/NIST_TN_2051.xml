    <abstract>The Smart Grid Profile is an initial attempt to apply risk management strategies from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework) to the smart grid. The Profile provides cybersecurity risk management guidance to power system owners/operators by prioritizing cybersecurity activities based on their effectiveness in helping power system owners/operators achieve common high-level business objectives for the smart grid. The Profile also provides a list of considerations relevant to the challenges power system owners/operators may experience as they implement these cybersecurity activities in infrastructures with high concentrations of distributed energy resources (DERs).</abstract>
