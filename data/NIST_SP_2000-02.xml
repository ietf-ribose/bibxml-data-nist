    <abstract>This document provides those not fully familiar with the field of conformity assessment an introduction to the complexities in developing, operating, using or relying on conformity assessment programs to meet Federal legislation or Federal government agency missions, regulations, or procurement requirements. We hope this document is informative and serves to enhance understanding of the purpose and nature of various aspects of conformity assessment and their application and use in Federal agency conformity assessment programs.</abstract>
