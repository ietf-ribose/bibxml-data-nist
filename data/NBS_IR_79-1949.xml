    <abstract>A study of the human factors aspects of five selected items of Navy equipment, namely, oxygen breathing apparatus, safety harness, emergency escape scuttle, life rails, and rotary observation windows, has been undertaken to ensure that the smaller size and lesser strength of females would not be a deterrent to the use of the equipment by women. The study involved a review of the applicable specifications for each item of equipment, a survey and enumeration of male and female anthropometric data, and a linking of engineering and anthropometric data. Each item has been assigned to a hazard category. Of the five items evaluated, two appear to pose significant problems when used by women. Fit and high deceleration forces were the major concerns for the safety harness while operating force requirements were critical for the escape scuttle. In addition, there were also some difficulties for some women in the use of the oxygen breathing apparatus.</abstract>
