    <abstract>By taking corrective action for electrical noise deriving from thermal agitation, alternating current pickup, and induced electrostatic charges, it has been possible to use a commercially available high gain d. c. amplifier and a recorder to balance a G-3 Mueller Bridge. Noise levels below 0. 01 microvolt peak to peak were observed with a response time of approximately five seconds. A precision of approximately two microhms was obtained in measuring a ten ohm resistor in a short series of measurements.</abstract>
