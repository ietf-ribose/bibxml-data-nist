    <abstract>The objective of this task was to develop a comprehensive long-range plan to research the seismic behavior of deep, slender wide flange structural steel beam-columns in steel frames. Development of the plan included the investigation of available information on beam-column member and connection behavior in the literature, and considered the differences and interrelationships between member, subassemblage, and system performance. The resulting plan includes a summary of tasks for conducting both experimental and analytical research, and is intended to be the first step in the development of national consensus guidelines for designing and assessing the seismic performance of deep, slender wide-flange beam-columns in steel frame systems.</abstract>
