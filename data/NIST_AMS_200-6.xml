    <abstract>This guide describes how to use the STEP File Analyzer and Viewer, a software tool that analyzes and generates a spreadsheet or a set of CSV (comma-separated value) files from a STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data) file. The spreadsheets simplify inspecting information in the STEP file at an entity and attribute level. STEP files can also be checked for conformance to recommended practices for Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) representation, PMI presentation, and validation properties. The STEP File Analyzer and Viewer also generates visualizations of boundary representation part geometry, graphical PMI annotations, tessellated part geometry, supplemental geometry, and finite element models.</abstract>
