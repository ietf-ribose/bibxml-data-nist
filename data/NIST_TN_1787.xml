    <abstract>This report summarizes research results to date under the FY2012 interagency agreement between CPSC and NIST to develop testing and measurement protocols for determining the quantities and properties of nanoparticles released from flooring finishes and interior paints. This report includes: 1) a critical assessment of products, 2) literature review of nanoparticle release from nanocomposite coatings and paints by mechanical forces, 3) surface morphology characterization of nano-filled flooring coatings and interior paints before abrasion, 4) materials and experiment to evaluate the use of a Taber abraser for generating particles from flooring coatings and interior paints, 5) experimental protocols for abrasion test and analyses of release particles and abraded surfaces, 6) concentration, size distribution and chemical composition data for release nanoparticles accumulated on nano-filled coating and paint surfaces under different abrading conditions and wheel type, and 7) preliminary data on chemical composition of abraded nano-filled flooring coating and interior paint surfaces.</abstract>
