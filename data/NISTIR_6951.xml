    <abstract>The Automated Security Self-Evaluation Tool (ASSET) automates the process of completing a system self-assessment. ASSET will assist organizations in completing the self-assessment questionnaire contained in NIST Special Publication (Special Publication) 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems. This technical manual is intended as a development guide for software engineers/database administrators who wish to troubleshoot unique installations of ASSET, reproduce the development version of ASSET, or extend the functionality of ASSET.</abstract>
