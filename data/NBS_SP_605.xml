    <abstract>NBS uses a decentralized system for managing the participation of NBS representatives in outside standards committee activities. This type of management is governed by NBS policy; coordinated through standards offices in each NBS Major Operational Unit; and monitored and supported by the Office of Standards Information, Analysis, and Development (OSIAD). These reports contain highlights of significant technical and individual contributions made by NBS staff, a description of NBS Standards management and information activities, and a directory of standards committees on which NBS staff serve.</abstract>
