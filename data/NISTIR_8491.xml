    <abstract>This report quantifes the accuracy of passive face presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (software only, no hardware solutions) operating on conventional 2D imagery of various presentation attack instruments (PAI). The algorithms were submitted to the Presentation Attack Detection track of the Face Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</abstract>
