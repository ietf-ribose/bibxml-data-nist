    <abstract>Mobile applications are an integral part of our everyday personal and professional lives. As both public and private organizations rely more on mobile applications, ensuring that they are reasonably free from vulnerabilities and defects becomes paramount. This paper outlines and details a mobile application vetting process. This process can be used to ensure that mobile applications conform to an organization s security requirements and are reasonably free from vulnerabilities.</abstract>
