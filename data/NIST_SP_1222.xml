    <abstract>The 2017 NIST/DHS/FDA Workshop: Standards for Pathogen Detection for Biosurveillance and Clinical Applications brought together subject matter experts from the clinical and biosurveillance communities to discuss standards to support the use of next generation sequencing for pathogen detection. The presentations, panel discussion, and break-out sessions focused on development and utilization of reference materials and standard operating procedures to assess measurement biases and overcome measurement and bioinformatic challenges and regulatory hurdles. This workshop was the third NIST-hosted workshop on sequencing for pathogen detection/identification since 2014. Pathogen detection is relevant to a number of programmatic priorities within the NIST Material Measurement Laboratory including microbial metrology, precision medicine, biomanufacturing, biodefense/forensics, food safety, antibiotic resistance, and water quality. Thus, it is our intention at NIST to continue to host this workshop theme approximately every two years.</abstract>
