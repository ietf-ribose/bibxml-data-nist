    <abstract>This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in the preparation of calibration solutions for a candidate reference measurement procedure for human serum albumin (HSA) in human urine. This candidate reference measurement procedure is being developed by NIST to be used in the certification of a matrix-based reference material to support the clinical measurement of HSA in human urine. In addition to its use to support the reference measurement system for the clinical measurement of HSA in human urine, SRM 2925 Human Serum Albumin Solution can be used as a reference standard for assays of total protein by colorimetric methods. SRM 2925 may also be used for other procedures, such as gel diffusion, amino acid analysis, electrophoresis, proteomics experimental workflows, or other tests that require a well-characterized protein for calibration or evaluation. The recombinant HSA protein content of this SRM was determined using amino acid analysis. A unit of SRM 2925 consists of 3 vials, each containing approximately 0.5 mL of solution. This publication documents the analytical methods and statistical evaluations involved in realizing this product.</abstract>
