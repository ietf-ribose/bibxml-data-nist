    <abstract>The CCQM_Retrospectoscope system combines a nominally complete database of results from Consultative Committee for the Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM) studies with a number of graphical tools for trying to make sense of the data. This system supports a diverse collection of often eye-opening appraisals of participation and measurement performance throughout the history of the CCQM activities. The appraisals include the bias, uncertainty, and degrees of equivalence of results submitted by individual national metrology or designated institutes (NMI|DIs); the relative performance of NMI|DIs, and the uncertainty function characteristic of entire Working Groups (WGs). The system is implemented in Excel using Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programs. It runs on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.</abstract>
