    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat- and water-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Summer 2015 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXVIII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin 43 Total Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum. To avoid increasing participation fees, the overhead costs for these programs were minimized by shipping the materials in January 2015 together with the samples for FSV Round Robin LXXVII and VC Round Robin 42. Participants were requested not to analyze any of the Summer samples before June 22, 2015 but to provide their measurement results by September 1, 2015. Participants were reminded of the due-date by e-mail in early August, 2015.</abstract>
