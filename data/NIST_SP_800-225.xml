    <abstract>During Fiscal Year 2022 (FY 2022) – from October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022 –the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy Program successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security and privacy. This Annual Report highlights the FY 2022 research activities for the ITL Cybersecurity and Privacy Program, including: the ongoing participation and development of international standards; research and practical applications in several key priority areas (e.g., Post Quantum Cryptography, updating the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0) and some new CSF profiles); accomplishments in the area of improving software and supply chain cybersecurity; IoT cybersecurity guidelines work; National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) projects, and setting up a new comment site for NIST’s Risk Management Framework work. NIST also celebrated a 50th anniversary in cybersecurity and the NCCoE celebrated a 10-year anniversary since inception.</abstract>
