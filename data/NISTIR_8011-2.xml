    <abstract>The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each individual information security capability, adding tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume 1, and providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST standards-compliant automated assessment. This document, Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) information security capability. The focus of the HWAM capability is to manage risk created by unmanaged devices on a network. Unmanaged devices are targets that attackers can use to gain and more easily maintain a persistent platform from which to attack the rest of the network.</abstract>
