    <abstract>The Sensor Handbook is intended as a guide for those who design, specify, use, and test military automatic test equipment containing sensors. The handbook addresses measurands and principles of measurement, data acquisition, sensor calibration and testing, environmental considerations, stability, durability, reliability, and error assessment. Sensor manufacturers and sensor calibration and evaluation resources are included, as is an annotated bibliography. The handbook is based largely on the present, proved state-of-the-art. Possible future trends are briefly discussed. The handbook is addressed to the general engineer, system designer, or manager with an engineering background. It does not provide the highly detailed technical information needed by the measurement engineer, although ample references are included for further study.</abstract>
