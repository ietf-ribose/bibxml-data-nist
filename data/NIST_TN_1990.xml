    <abstract>The set of software metrics introduced by Maurice H. Halstead in the 1970's has seen much scrutiny and not infrequent criticism. This article takes a fresh look at these metrics using quantity calculus (the algebra of units) and a new approach to dimensionless units. In this way, it is possible to assign units to the major Halstead metrics in a manner that is logically consistent. However, Halstead's repurposing of counts of software attributes as counts of unobservable mental events leads to a less plausible, more confusing set of metrics for coding effort than for software attributes.</abstract>
