    <abstract>This publication describes an approach for the development of Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program assessments that can be used to evaluate ISCM programs within federal, state, and local governmental organizations and commercial enterprises. An ISCM program assessment provides organizational leadership with information on the effectiveness and completeness of the organization's ISCM program, including the review of ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, operations, and analysis of continuous monitoring data. The ISCM assessment approach can be used as presented or as the starting point for an organization-specific methodology. It includes example evaluation criteria and assessment procedures that can be applied to organizations.</abstract>
