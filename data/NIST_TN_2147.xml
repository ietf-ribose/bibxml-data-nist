    <abstract>This report presents a laboratory-based characterization of Long Term Evolution (LTE) User Equipment (UE) emissions under closed-loop power control, building on our prior work (NIST TN 2069), which assessed the impact of a large number of factors affecting UE emissions. Specifically, this investigation aims to shed light on real-world UE behavior through rigorous measurements of uplink power per physical resource block under a variety of realistic conditions and settings. In addition, this work provides insight into the relationship between the UE-reported uplink power and the actual power radiated by the UE. Although the results presented here pertain to LTE equipment operating in a specific frequency band, LTE Band 66 (1710 MHz - 1780 MHz), the measurement method is presented in enough detail that additional investigations can be performed in other bands of interest. The report concludes with a summary of contributions on a variety of uplink emissions topics of common interest to those developing interference models and coexistence strategies.</abstract>
