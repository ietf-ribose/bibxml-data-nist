    <abstract>In responding to ASHRAE SPC 155P's interest and to provide additional evidence on the envisioned linear relationship between output and input of a boiler under part load conditions, the National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook to conduct a series of computer simulations utilizing a revised version of a computer simulation program, DEPAB2, which was developed previously by NIST for commercial fire-tube steam boilers. The computer program was modified so that it can be used to simulate the operations of a commercial fire tube hot water boiler, and actual boiler specification data from a leading boiler manufacturer was obtained and used as input data to the program for the simulation study. In this paper, the computer model of a commercial hot water boiler and the actual boiler specification are described. Full and part-load performance of the simulated, commercial hot water boiler is presented. A good correlation between output energy and input energy is found. Based upon the correlationship, a suggestion is made to reduce experimental burden in testing the performance of commercial boilers.</abstract>
