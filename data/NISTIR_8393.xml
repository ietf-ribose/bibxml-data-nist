    <abstract>In two prior National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Journal of Research publications (Parts I and II) [1,2], we presented test procedures to detect instrument geometry errors in industrial cone beam X-ray computed tomography (XCT) systems. These test procedures were based on simulations performed at one position of the measurement volume (one geometrical configuration of the instrument), i.e., for fixed locations of the rotation stage (400 mm from the source) and the detector (1177 mm from the source). In a subsequent NIST Journal of Research publication (Part III) [3], we reported results from simulations performed at various combinations of the rotation stage and detector distances from the source. Because of the large number of simulations, we abstracted the information and reported key observations only. This internal report presents the underlying data generated from the simulations performed for the Part III publication and may therefore be considered an addendum to that publication.</abstract>
