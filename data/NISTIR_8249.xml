    <abstract>The NIST Health Assessment Measurements Quality Assurance Program (HAMQAP) was launched in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various regulations by measuring samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human output (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum of health assessment. Exercise 2 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (iodine), contaminants (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and selenium), water-soluble vitamins (folates), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A and E), fatty acids, and natural product compounds (eleutherosides and co-enzyme Q10) in foods and dietary supplements, and biomarkers/metabolites in clinical specimens (including human serum, blood, and urine).</abstract>
