    <abstract>Executive Order (EO) 13717: Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management Standard establishes minimum seismic requirements for new and existing buildings that will be constructed, altered, leased, financed, or regulated by the Federal Government. These requirements help to enhance the seismic resilience of agencies by reducing risk to lives of building occupants and improving the probability of continued performance of buildings essential to agency mission following future earthquakes. The EO rescinds EO 12941: Seismic Safety of Existing Federally Owned or Leased Buildings and EO 12699: Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction. The EO requires that agencies whose activities are covered by the order submit a biennial report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on their progress in implementing the order, commencing two years from the date of the order. It is assumed that agencies that are covered by the EO participate on the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC). NIST, as the lead agency of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and thus Secretariat of the ICSSC, is required by the EO to summarize agency compliance of the order in the biennial NEHRP report to Congress. This report serves as the summary of agency progress in implementing the EO and covers the biennial reporting period of February 2, 2020 to February 1, 2022. Sixteen reports covering sixty-six agencies (department, agency, bureau, office, institute, etc.) were received by NIST for this reporting period.</abstract>
