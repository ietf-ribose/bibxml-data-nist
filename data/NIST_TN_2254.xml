    <abstract>Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in computational mechanics and earthquake engineering. Sensitivity analysis of a model (either numerical or physical) aims at quantifying the relative importance of each input parameter, their potential interaction, and their effects on the model response. Sensitivity analysis has a long-term application in structural engineering more specifically on reinforced concrete RC structures. Many researchers benefited from the results of sensitivity analysis to reduce the uncertainty domain to those variables which are very important. This further helps in uncertainty quantification by accelerating the entire process. This state-of-the-art technical report provides a comprehensive review of classical sensitivity analysis techniques, followed by an in-depth review of all the related documents that implemented a full sensitivity analysis or partially adopted it for uncertainty quantification-related discussions. This review report on sensitivity analysis of reinforced concrete structures is a valuable contribution to the field of computational mechanics and earthquake engineering. This review highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate sensitivity analysis technique to achieve reliable results in structural analysis and design. By providing insights into the advantages and limitations of various sensitivity analysis techniques, this report can guide researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate technique for their specific applications. It is observed that the outcome of a sensitivity analysis depends heavily on the applied technique to perform the sensitivity assessment which eventually may cause a significant bias during the decision making. This report paves the road for better selection of a sensitivity analysis technique in problems related to structural and earthquake engineering. The findings of this review have significant implications for improving the accuracy and reliability of structural analysis, ultimately leading to safer and more resilient structures.</abstract>
