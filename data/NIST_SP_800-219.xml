    <abstract>The macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP) provides resources that system administrators, security professionals, security policy authors, information security officers, and auditors can leverage to secure and assess macOS desktop and laptop system security in an automated way. This publication introduces the mSCP and gives an overview of the resources available from the project's GitHub site, which is continuously curated and updated to support each new release of macOS. The GitHub site provides practical, actionable recommendations in the form of secure baselines and associated rules. This publication also describes use cases for leveraging the mSCP content.</abstract>
