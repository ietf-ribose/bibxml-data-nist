    <abstract>HAMQAP was launched in collaboration with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements in samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human metabolism (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum of health assessment. Exercise 4 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (calcium, potassium, and sodium), contaminants (cadmium and lead, nitrates and nitrites), watersoluble vitamins (vitamin B12), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins K1 and K2), fatty acids (select omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids), and botanicals (phenolics) in foods and dietary supplements, and corresponding biomarkers/metabolites in clinical specimens (human sera).</abstract>
