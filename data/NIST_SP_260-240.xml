    <abstract>Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 3383 Yohimbe-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form was developed as part of a collaborative effort between the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). SRM 3383 was produced from multiple commercial dietary supplements containing yohimbe to replicate typical analytical challenges associated with the measurement of yohimbine in a finished product sample matrix. The material was prepared at NIST and packaged by High Purity Standards, an experienced contract manufacturer. A certified value for yohimbine has been assigned based upon data obtained from NIST. A description of the material, sample preparations, results, and data analysis are discussed in the following report.</abstract>
