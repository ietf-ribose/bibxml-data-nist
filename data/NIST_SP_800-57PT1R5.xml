    <abstract>This Recommendation provides cryptographic key-management guidance. It consists of three parts. Part 1 provides general guidance and best practices for the management of cryptographic keying material, including definitions of the security services that may be provided when using cryptography and the algorithms and key types that may be employed, specifications of the protection that each type of key and other cryptographic information requires and methods for providing this protection, discussions about the functions involved in key management, and discussions about a variety of key-management issues to be addressed when using cryptography. Part 2 provides guidance on policy and security planning requirements for U.S. government agencies. Part 3 provides guidance when using the cryptographic features of current systems.</abstract>
