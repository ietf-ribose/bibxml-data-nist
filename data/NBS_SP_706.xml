    <abstract>In September 1983, the '8th U.S. - German Seminar of State and Planning on Environmental Specimen Banking' and the 'International Review of Environmental Specimen Banking' were held at the National Bureau of Standards. At these meetings the current status of Environmental Specimen Banking Program in the U.S., Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and other countries was presented and discussed. The publication contains a brief summary of these meetings and separate contributions describing the specimen banking activities in Canada, FRG, Japan, Sweden and the U.S.</abstract>
