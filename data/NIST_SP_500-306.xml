    <abstract>The document describes the procedure by which fingerprint image downsampling procedures will be evaluated with respect to conformance to the NIST guidance for sample rate reduction of 1000 ppi friction ridge images to 500 ppi as specified in NIST Special Publication 500-289. This guidance is to be followed whenever 1000 ppi images are to be prepared for comparison to legacy 500 ppi fingerprint databases for submittal to the FBI's Next Generation identification system and conformance will ensure that CODECs produce encoded files that retain fidelity to the non-compressed source images within empirically set limits and that such files can be decoded by other conformant JPEG 2000 CODECs maintaining the required fidelity. The document describes the attributes of a set of fingerprint images selected for certification testing and the rationale for selection of these images based on spatial frequency fidelity of downsampled images to non-compressed images scanned at 500 ppi where downsampling is performed using the Gaussian filter with subsampling method specified in NIST SP 500-289. The document describes the procedure to be followed in have an algorithm tested for certification, the metric used to measure conformance, and provides instructions on how to run the protocol and submit results to NIST for evaluation.</abstract>
