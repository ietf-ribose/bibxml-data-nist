    <abstract>During Fiscal Year 2020 (FY 2020), from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020, the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy Program successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security and privacy. The FY 2020 annual report is grouped into nine priority areas, including: Cybersecurity Awareness and Education; Identity and Access Management; Metrics and Measurement; Risk Management; Privacy Engineering; Emerging Technologies; Cryptographic Standards and Validation; Trustworthy Networks and Trustworthy Platforms. The report also includes specific projects of importance that don't fall into the focus areas.</abstract>
