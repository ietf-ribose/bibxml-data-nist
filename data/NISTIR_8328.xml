    <abstract>Access time generally describes the time associated with the establishment of a talk pathupon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component of quality of experience (QoE) in voice communications. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) division has previouslydeveloped an access time measurement method [1]. Improvements were implemented inthe access delay measurement method to better handle the idiosyncrasies of the variouspush-to-talk (PTT) technologies tested. These improvements include a more robust audioalignment procedure, and graceful communications failure detection and handling. Thispaper covers those improvements to the access delay measurement system, results of testingProject 25 (P25) technologies with and without encryption turned on, as well as someinitial Long Term Evolution (LTE) measurements.</abstract>
