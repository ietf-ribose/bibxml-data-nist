    <abstract>The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP) was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplements community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various regulations including the dietary supplement current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). Exercise M of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (potassium and zinc), contaminants (arsenic and lead), water-soluble vitamins (thiamine (B1) and riboflavin (B2)), fat-soluble vitamins (total vitamin K1, cis- and trans-vitamin K1), botanical marker compounds (curcuminoids, chondroitin sulfate), and identity (chondroitin) in foods and/or botanical dietary supplement ingredients and finished products.</abstract>
