    <abstract>This Telecommunication Security Guideline is intended to provide a security baseline for Network Elements (NEs) and Mediation Devices (MDs) that is based on commercial security needs. In addition, some National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) security requirements will be integrated into the baseline to address specific network security needs. The guideline should assist telecommunications vendors in developing systems and service providers in implementing systems with appropriate security for integration into the Public Switched Network (PSN). It can also be used by a government agency or a commercial organization to formulate a specific security policy. It does not stipulate regulatory requirements or mandated standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</abstract>
