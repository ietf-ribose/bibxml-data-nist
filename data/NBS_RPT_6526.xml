    <abstract>Resistance strain gages of the SS-E-4D-A series, manufactured by Micro-Test, Inc., were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics determined were (1) gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing temperature, (3) drift, (4)resistance-temperature relationship, (5) behavior under transient heating conditions, and (6) behavior when subjected to large strains. The results of these tests indicate that these gages, when attached to stainless steel, have repeatable gage factor characteristics, a very low temperature coefficient of resistance, low drift at temperatures up to 700¿̐¿ F, and the ability to withstand large tensile strains without failure.</abstract>
