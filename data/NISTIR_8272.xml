    <abstract>As awareness of cybersecurity supply chain risks grows among federal agencies, there is a greater need for tools that evaluate the impacts of a supply chain-related cyber event. This can be a difficult activity, especially for those organizations with complex operational environments and supply chains. A publicly available tool to support supply chain risk analysis that specifically takes into account the potential impact of an event does not currently exist. This publication describes how to use the Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Interdependency Tool that has been developed to help federal agencies identify and assess the potential impact of cybersecurity events in their interconnected supply chains.</abstract>
