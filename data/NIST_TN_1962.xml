    <abstract>At a time when more than 70% of the calls made to 911 are placed from cell phones, it is vital for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to be able to dispatch emergency responders to the right location for the caller. A major challenge in this area is the location accuracy of E911 calls placed from inside buildings. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)1 , more than 10,000 people, who would otherwise be saved, die every year when calling 911 from a cellphone because emergency dispatchers can⁰₉t get a quick and accurate location on them. The latest rules from the FCC require 50- meter horizontal location accuracy or providing dispatchable location for 80% of E911 calls by April 2021. As for vertical accuracy, the FCC has called for one or more vertical (z-axis) location accuracy metrics to be defined by nationwide providers and certain benchmarks, yet to be defined, based on those metrics to be met by certain dates. The Safety App from 911Cellular, LLC is a Wi-Fi-based app for placing E911 calls. In December 2016, NIST tested and evaluated the Safety App in a comprehensive manner according to the procedures of the international standard ISO/IEC 18305, Test and evaluation of localization and tracking systems, in a large, four-story building on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The Safety App achieved an average horizontal accuracy of 7.45 meters, it had a horizontal accuracy of 15.11 meters or better in 95% of the area of the building, and correctly decided from which floor the E911 call was placed in 87.6% of the area of the building. These results for a technology that is available today are far better than what FCC rules have called for by 2021. However, to achieve this level of accuracy everywhere (i.e., in every building), there has to be good Wi-Fi coverage and access to the Internet everywhere. The key questions are (i) what the penetration rate of Wi-Fi is now and (ii) what it will be by 2021. One clear trend is that Wi-Fi is being deployed in more buildings every day. When Wi-Fi access to the Internet is not available, the Safety App falls back to the use of GPS and RF signals received by the cellular base stations from the cell phone, which are the traditional solutions to estimate the location of E911 calls. Therefore, one point that can be made is that Wi-Fi-based E911 solutions should be used along with the traditional solutions to improve the indoor location accuracy of E911 calls, just as the 911Cellular Safety App does. The Safety App has a very simple operation and its performance does not degrade in high rise buildings. Even though NIST tested the Safety App in a four-story building, the App⁰₉s performance would be just as good in a 100-story building, as long as the Wi-Fi coverage on all floors of the building are the same. Nevertheless, it is important to test the Safety App in a few other buildings to study the effects of various construction materials, layout, etc. This report presents in detail the testing methodology and test results that were obtained.</abstract>
