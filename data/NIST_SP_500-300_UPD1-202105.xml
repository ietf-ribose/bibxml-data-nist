    <abstract>The document describes the procedure by which applications of JPEG 2000 CODECs will be evaluated with respect to conformance to the NIST guidance for compression of 1000 ppi friction ridge images as detailed in NIST Special Publication 500-289 [NIST3]. The document describes the attributes of a set of fingerprint images selected for conformance testing and the rationale for selection of these images based on both examiner assessment of image quality over increasing degrees of JPEG 2000 compression and relative fidelity based on computational metrics described SP 500-289 and supporting studies. The document provides background behind the conformance testing, describes the CODEC pathways to be tested and the metrics used to measure conformance, and provides instructions on how to run the protocol and submit results to NIST for evaluation.</abstract>
