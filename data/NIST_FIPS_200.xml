    <abstract>FIPS 200 is the second standard that was specified by the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (FISMA). It is an integral part of the risk management framework that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed to assist federal agencies in providing levels of information security based on levels of risk. FIPS 200 specifies minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems and a risk-based process for selecting the security controls necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements.</abstract>
