    <abstract>NIST Handbook 150-31 presents the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Health Information Technology Testing program. It is intended for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2017 edition of NIST Handbook 150-31 supersedes and replaces the 2011 edition. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-31 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Health Information Technology Testing program.
