    <abstract>This report summarizes the presentations, discussions and recommendations of a workshop held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in December of 2011. The purpose of the workshop was to identify challenges, research, and implementation issues in product design, manufacturing, and quality assurance where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in the product's lifecycle. The report includes an overview of model-based engineering and its technical challenges, summaries of the presentations given at the workshop, and conclusions that emerged from the presentations and discussions.</abstract>
