    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) have partnered to investigate the application of digital manufacturing methods and technologies within the navy shipyard. As a part of the effort, wireless network deployments are considered. This report provides an overview of the wireless networking requirements of navy shipyards specifically for the transmission of machine information outside and inside of the vessel during construction. Recommended approaches are included with each use case. This report is intended to provide the reader with direction to other larger resources and documentation provided by NIST.</abstract>
