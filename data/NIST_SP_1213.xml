    <abstract>Large outdoor fires present a risk to the built environment. In this workshop, presentations highlighted large outdoor fires throughout the world, and explored common characteristics between these fires. Specifically, each presentation provided an overview of the large outdoor fire risk to the built environment from each region, and highlighted critical research needs for this problem in the context of fire safety science. The workshop seeks to develop the foundation for an international research needs roadmap to reduce the risk of large outdoor fires to the built environment. This workshop also provided a forum for next generation researchers to contribute to this important topic.</abstract>
