    <abstract>A powder capture capsule has been designed to capture thin regions of powder at multiple heights within a powder bed of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) equipment. This design is stackable, support free, and allows powder capture from a targeted region (stacked layers) of the powder bed. Extraction is ergonomic, quick, and does not require any special tools; it also ensures sufficient powder for post analyses. An approximate apparent density of the powder bed pertaining to the region under investigation has also been evaluated in this test case.</abstract>
