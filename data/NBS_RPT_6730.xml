    <abstract>Tropospheric forward scatter circuits have established their place in the world-wide communications network of the military and it is the intent of this paper to illustrate by a specific example how the performance of a circuit of this type may be predicted with adequate accuracy without making costly transmission loss measurements over the intended path.</abstract>
