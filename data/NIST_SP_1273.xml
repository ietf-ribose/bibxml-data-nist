    <abstract>As stated in Executive Order (EO) 14019, Promoting Access to Voting, the right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. The EO further recognizes that People with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights and the ability to vote privately and independently. NIST produced this NIST Special Publication in response to its responsibilities described in Section 7 of the EO. NIST was specifically tasked to: 1. Evaluate the steps needed to ensure that the online National Mail Voter Registration Form is accessible to people with disabilities, and 2. Identify barriers and publish recommendations to remove barriers preventing individuals with disabilities from voting. Five systemic barriers voters with disabilities face throughout the voting process for privately and independently voting are identified. Recommended actions to overcome these barriers and promote access to voting for voters with disabilities are described. In many cases, existing best practices and guidance are recommended to be broadly applied to voting systems and processes across the country. This publication also presents recommendations to address barriers identified in specific aspects of the voting process that includes voter registration and the National Mail Voter Registration Form, vote-by-mail, using voting technology for in-person voting, voting at polling locations, and training and documentation for poll workers.</abstract>
