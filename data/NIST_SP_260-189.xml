    <abstract>Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2372a is intended for use in the value assignment of human genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) forensic quantitation materials. A unit of SRM 2372a consists of three well-characterized human genomic DNA materials solubilized in 10 mmol/L 2- amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3 propanediol hydrochloride (Tris HCl) and 0.1 mmol/L thylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (disodium EDTA) pH 8.0 buffer (TE 4). The three component genomic DNA materials, labeled A, B, and C, are respectively derived from a single male donor, a single female donor, and 1:3 mixture of a male and a female donor. A unit of the SRM consists of one 0.5 mL tube of each component, each tube containing approximately 55 ℗ÿL of DNA solution. Each of these tubes is labeled and is sealed with a color coded screw cap. This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and statistical evaluations involved in production of this SRM.</abstract>
