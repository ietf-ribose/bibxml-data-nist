    <abstract>This report summarizes the results from the 2018 NIST/OAGi Workshop: Enabling Composable ServiceOriented Manufacturing Systems, which was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology campus in Gaithersburg, MD, on April 23-24, 2018. This was the fourth in this series of workshops begun in 2015 to foster a shared vision of a new Smart Manufacturing (SM) platform to support Composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing (SOM) systems. The purpose of the workshop series is to identify and discuss challenges in advancing the vision within the context of open cloud service platforms for Smart Manufacturing systems. Like the previous workshop reports, the document gives (1) summaries of presentations on Smart Manufacturing and the theme of Composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing systems, (2) summaries of the six breakout sessions, each providing a unique perspective on the theme, and (3) the key findings from the workshop.</abstract>
