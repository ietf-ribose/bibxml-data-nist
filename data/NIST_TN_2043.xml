    <abstract>Cone calorimetric experiments of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) and FPUF covered with a variety of fire-blocking barrier fabrics (BFs) were used to characterize and rank the effectiveness of BFs for reducing the flammability of residential upholstered furniture (RUF). In addition to BF properties, it was demonstrated that the burning behaviors of the FPUF/BF composites were sensitive to a wide range of experimental parameters including the sample configuration, heat losses to the underlying support base, and the two-stage pyrolysis behavior of the FPUF. Measurements using thermocouples (TCs) placed within the FPUF provided insights on FPUF pyrolysis behavior, the collapse rate of FPUF, and the thermal protective properties of barrier materials. Seven out of 16 FPUF/BF composites exhibited flame extinction during testing. Five out of the seven composites reignited when the spark ignition source was reapplied. Reignition allowed BF effectiveness to be assessed even for cases with flame extinction. Heat release rate (HRR) temporal profiles were measured for bare FPUF and the FPUF/BF composites. For cases where large rapid changes in HRR, e.g., during flash burning of a BF, occurred, it was necessary to correct the profiles for the finite time response of the cone calorimeter. The HRR curves for FPUF consisted of two distinct burning periods which were previously associated with sequential burning of foam pyrolyzates derived from the isocyanate and deposited liquid polyol components used in its manufacture. Tests with two different underlying substrates demonstrated the sensitivity of the second-stage liquid burning to heat losses from the sample holder. The majority of the HRR curves for the FPUF/BF composites showed evidence for three-stage burning, which was attributed to initial flash burning of the BF followed by the two-stage burning of the underlying FPUF. For most of the composites, the largest HRR peak, which is often used as the primary indicator for a material's flammability, occurred during the short-lived burning of the BF. Since this is not an appropriate measure of BF effectiveness, it is proposed here that effectiveness should be based on a BF's ability to reduce the HRR from the underlying FPUF. In general, the presence of a BF was shown to reduce the HRR peak values during both FPUF burning stages. The magnitude of the peak associated with second-stage FPUF burning (denoted PHRR2) was deemed the most appropriate for characterizing the thermal protection provided by a BF. Since the times for PHRR2 also varied between composites, a measurement referred to as the peak fire growth rate (PFIGRA) parameter was calculated by dividing the PHRR by time since time to ignition was also considered for characterizing the BFs. Three possible classification schemes, each consisting of three classes, were introduced based on composite flame extinction and reignition behavior, PHRR2 values, and PFIGRA2 values. Each scheme provided differentiation between BF effectiveness. While the schemes were able to assess whether the BFs were particularly effective or ineffective, there were variations among classes of BFs having intermediate levels of effectiveness. Further work will be required to assess which, if any, of the classification schemes are most appropriate for predicting BF performance in RUF. BF performance was shown to be associated with four properties that were previously identified as important BF properties: BF flammability, gas permeability, thermal protection, and physical integrity. In addition, the current experiments indicate the presence and effectiveness of gas-phase active flame retardants in the BF can also play an important role. A limited number of tests were conducted to de-couple the effects of flame-retardant chemicals and physical effects of BFs on FPUF burning behavior. These tests showed that while flameretardant chemicals can be effective in quenching and extinguishing the flames, the presence of effective BF shells is also very important in lowering the HRR of burning FPUF.</abstract>
