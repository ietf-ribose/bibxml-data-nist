    <abstract>Technological change in the electric power sector has progressed rapidly and there now is need for the development and evaluation of new smart grid architectures. This special publication discusses the current conditions of the U.S. electric grid and the economics of interoperability within the context of five representative architectural tracks developed by Pacific Northwest National Labs.</abstract>
