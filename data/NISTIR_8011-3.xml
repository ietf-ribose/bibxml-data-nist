    <abstract>The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each individual information security capability, adding tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume 1, and providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST standards-compliant automated assessment. This document, Volume 3 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Software Asset Management (SWAM) information security capability. The focus of the SWAM capability is to manage risk created by unmanaged software on a network. Unmanaged software is a target that attackers can use as a platform from which to attack components on the network.</abstract>
