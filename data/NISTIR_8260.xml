    <abstract>In a previous special publication, NIST provided guidance for the compression of 1000 ppi fingerprint images using Part I of the JPEG 2000 standard. The present document extends the Guidance to the compression of 1000 ppi palm and whole-hand images. The NIST Spectral Image Validation Verification (SIVV) metric is used to determine JPEG 2000 compression ratios at which palm and hand images exhibit spectral fidelity to non-compressed source images comparable to that exhibited by fingerprint images compressed at 10:1. The investigators discuss the effect of untextured regions (i.e. large areas of low-texture or white space) in enabling compression ratios as high as 12:1 for palms and 22:1 for whole hand images as indicated by the spectral analysis. However, they note several factors that advise against deviating from the compression ratio recommended in the Guidance. Hence, NIST recommends that a single compression ratio, 10:1, be applied to all friction ridge impression types to ensure interoperability, in general, and support of latent matching, in particular.</abstract>
