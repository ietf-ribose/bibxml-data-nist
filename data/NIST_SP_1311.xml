    <abstract>This Volume 2 report serves as a companion document to Volume 1 that presents a framework to guide the reader through steps to achieve system level functional recovery of lifeline infrastructure systems exposed to earthquake events. The proposed framework comprises two constituent parts, one framework for assets and one for organizational actions. This Volume 2 report presents examples for applying the assets framework described in Volume 1 Ch. 4 to water, wastewater, and electric power systems and how the organizational actions framework described in Volume 1 Ch. 5 supports the development of functional recovery for the three infrastructure systems.</abstract>
