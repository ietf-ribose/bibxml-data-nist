    <abstract>This report provides an overview of the US manufacturing industry. There are three aspects of US manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the US industry compares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry, and (3) the industry trends compared to those in other countries. The US remains a major manufacturing nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly. US manufacturing was significantly impacted by the previous recession and has only recently returned to pre-recession levels of production and still remains below pre-recession employment levels. Although US manufacturing performs well in many respects, there are opportunities for advancing competitiveness. This will require strategic placement of resources to ensure that US investments have the highest return possible.</abstract>
