    <abstract>Non-technical supporting capabilities are actions a manufacturer or third-party organization performs in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device. This publication defines an Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers non-technical supporting capability core baseline, which is a set of non-technical supporting capabilities generally needed from manufacturers or other third parties to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organization s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems. The purpose of this publication is to provide organizations a starting point to use in identifying the non-technical supporting capabilities needed in relation to IoT devices they will manufacture, integrate, or acquire. This publication is intended to be used in conjunction with NISTIR 8259, Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers and NISTIR 8259A, IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline.</abstract>
