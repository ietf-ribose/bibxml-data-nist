    <abstract>This report of the Advanced Communications Technologies Working Group of the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP) provides an overview of Federal agency advanced communications technologies (ACT) standards activities and recommends standards priority areas for ICSP consideration. The ACT standards priorities recommendations section of the report sets out nine areas for consideration by the ICSP. The landscape review section provides an overview of each contributing agency's relevant ACT standards activities, including its mission, ACT goals, role in ACT standards, participation in standards development organizations, ACT focus areas, and examples of standards activities for each contributing Federal agency or office.</abstract>
