    <abstract>Despite broad recognition that air distribution plays an important role in comfort for residential buildings, previous efforts to evaluate and characterize the performance of residential air distribution systems have largely focused on their impact on the heating and cooling energy consumption. However, fewer studies addressed the effectiveness of the tested residential air distribution systems to provide and maintain comfort in the conditioned space by delivering the designed air temperature to individual rooms throughout the house. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop an improved understanding of the impact of residential air distribution systems on whole-house thermal comfort and to propose analytical methods for evaluating this impact.</abstract>
