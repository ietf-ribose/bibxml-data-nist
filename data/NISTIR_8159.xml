    <abstract>The use of biometrics to identify individuals has become an important component of efforts to ensure U.S. national security, and has also grown rapidly. Biometrics are, for example, an integral part of the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program. To address contagion and speed issues, DHS S commissioned and funded a project to research technologies that could be used to acquire fingerprints without physical contact. Overall the contactless scanner took longer to acquire the prints, acquired fewer prints under the no instruction and video instructional conditions, and was preferred less than the contact scanner.</abstract>
