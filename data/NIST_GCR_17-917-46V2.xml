    <abstract>In September 2014, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) commenced a task order project under National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Contract SB1341-13-CQ-0009 to develop guidance for nonlinear dynamic analysis (ATC-114 Project). The need for such guidance is identified as high-priority research and development topic (Proposed Research Initiative 6) in NIST GCR 14-917-27 report, Nonlinear Analysis Research and Development Program for Performance-Based Seismic Engineering (NIST, 2013), which outlines a research and development program for addressing the gap between state-of-the-art academic research and state-of-practice engineering applications for nonlinear structural analysis, analytical structural modeling, and computer simulation in support of performance-based seismic engineering. In addition, the NIST GCR 09-917-2 report, Research Required to Support Full Implementation of Performance-Based Seismic Design (NIST, 2009), also identified the need to improve analytical models for buildings and their components in near-collapse seismic loading. To help fill this gap, the ATC-114 Project developed a series of reports that provide general nonlinear modeling and nonlinear analysis guidance, as well as guidance specific to the following two structural systems: structural steel moment frames and reinforced concrete moment frames. This Part IIa report, referred to as Guidelines herein, provide practical guidance for nonlinear modeling and analysis specific to steel moment-resisting frames and their components. It is a companion to Part I Guidelines (NIST, 2017) that provides general guidance on nonlinear analysis. Other Part II companion reports provide further details for selected system types.</abstract>
