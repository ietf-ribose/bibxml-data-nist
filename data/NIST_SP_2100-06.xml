    <abstract>On September 6 and 7, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) convened a roundtable discussion and workshop with a diverse group of forensic science thought leaders representing various local, state, federal, and private forensic laboratories, academia, and the legal system throughout the United States. This meeting gave participants the opportunity to provide their perspectives on major challenges to forensic science practices in the United States and how research and standards can address those challenges. This report summarizes the views and opinions expressed by participants during the plenary and breakout sessions.</abstract>
