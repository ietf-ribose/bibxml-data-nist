    <abstract>These guidelines describe the important considerations for planning, conducting, analyzing, and disseminating the results of a Home Performance Contactor (HPC) round robin study of a specific aspect of the HPC industry services. The round robin study focuses on gathering information needed to provide a better understanding of the variability in any number of performance characteristics of interest to a particular sector of the HPC industry. For example, a round robin can be used to estimate variability in the estimated energy performance of a given home, the necessary sizing of particular equipment, the potential savings from retrofit options, or a ranked list of cost-effective retrofit measures. Ultimately, it is anticipated that such activities will help developers of best practices, guidelines, and standards to improve those products to provide a more reliable prediction for the homeowner and to elicit confidence in those who will pay for enhanced building performance or measures to attain that performance.</abstract>
