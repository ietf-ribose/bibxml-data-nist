    <abstract>As more organizations share information electronically, a common understanding of what is needed and expected in securing information technology (IT) resources is required. This document provides a baseline that organizations can use to establish and review their IT security programs. The document gives a foundation that organizations can reference when conducting multi-organizational business as well as internal business. Management, internal auditors, users, system developers, and security practioners can use the guideline to gain an understanding of the basic security requirements most IT systems should contain. The foundation begins with generally accepted system security principles and continues with common practices that are used in securing IT systems.</abstract>
