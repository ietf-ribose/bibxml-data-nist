    <abstract>Among the many classes of engineered nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are one of the most widely studied and utilized nanoscale platforms for biomedical applications including diagnostics, therapeutics, and transfection. This is due in part to their general biocompatibility, facile synthesis and unique optical properties.3 To realize these achievements, a systematic evaluation of GNP stability, particularly under physiologically relevant conditions, is critical for the efficacious and safe application of GNPs in any biomedical or technical application. A lack of well documented and reproducible protocols motivated the development of the present collection of methods, which address stability with respect to aging, different media, pH, temperature, chemical resistance, and long-term storage.</abstract>
