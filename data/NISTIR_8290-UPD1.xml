    <abstract>SCAP Composer is a software application from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for creating Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP pronounced ess-cap) source data stream collections. A source data stream collection is a bundle of Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents, each of which must be valid with respect to a schema defined in an SCAP component specification. SCAP Composer's limited scope and small footprint make it easy to install, use, and integrate with other SCAP content development tools. SCAP Composer uses the DITA Open Toolkit, an open source publishing engine for content authored in the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). SCAP Composer may be used with the NIST SCAP Content Validation Tool to check the conformance of SCAP source data stream components to content requirements and recommendations.</abstract>
