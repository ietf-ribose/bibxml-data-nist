    <abstract>This document describes potential use-cases for data interoperability in election technology components not previously considered in past efforts. Such components include on-demand ballot printing systems, remote ballot marking systems and electronic poll books. Each component is described along with a set of generalized functions it performs. Existing common data formats are considered for their applicability to component functions. Where gaps are found, suggestions to enhance interoperability are described.</abstract>
