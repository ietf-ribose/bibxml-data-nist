    <abstract>These specifications and tolerances establish the minimum requirements for Field Standards used by State and local weights and measures officials and others in the regulatory verification of weighing devices used in quantity determination of commodities sold by weight. Non-Weights and Measures users may find this handbook helpful in the design of field standard weights, but the requirements should not be considered mandatory for special applications outside of the scope of regulatory weights and measures. The Handbook 105 series of publications are the specifications and tolerances for reference standards and field standards used in weights and measures (legal metrology) applications. This Handbook 105-1 is the first in the series and is specific for the application of weights used for testing scales for compliance to NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices.</abstract>
