    <abstract>This bibliography cites selected books and articles on computer security published from January 1980 through October 1989. To have been selected, an article had to be substantial in content and have been published in professional or technical journals, magazines, or conference proceedings. Only very substantial articles from the popular or trade press were included. English language articles from foreign journals were included as available. The citations are listed under nine categories. A tenth category of pre-1980 publications is also provided, as well as an appendix containing addresses of all journals and magazines referenced in the bibliography.</abstract>
