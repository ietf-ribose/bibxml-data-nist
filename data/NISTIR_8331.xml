    <abstract>This is the second of a series of reports on the performance of face recognition algorithms on faces occluded by protective face masks commonly worn to reduce inhalation and exhalation of viruses. This is a continuous study is being run under the Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In our first report, we tested "pre-pandemic" algorithms that were already submitted to FRVT 1:1 prior to mid-March 2020. This report augments its predecessor with results for more recent algorithms provided to NIST after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. While we do not have information on whether or not a particular algorithm was designed with face coverings in mind, the results show evidence that a number of developers have adapted their algorithms to support face recognition on subjects potentially wearing face masks. The algorithms tested were one- to-one algorithms submitted to the FRVT 1:1 Verification track. Future editions of this document will also report accuracy of one-to- many algorithms.</abstract>
