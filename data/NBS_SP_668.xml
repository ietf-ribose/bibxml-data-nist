    <abstract>An international workshop on the backfill A component of a multi-barrier under-ground isolation system for nuclear waste disposal/storage was conducted on April 13 and 14, 1981, at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC. This report includes the papers presented and/or submitted to the workshop for publication. It also contains the surveyed results of a questionnaire distributed to the participants at the workshop. The workshop held a one-day informal indepth discussion on the subject and a summary of these discussions is included in this report, which states areas where further research and development needs are required to better understand the fundamental mechanisms of the backfill in the waste repository.</abstract>
