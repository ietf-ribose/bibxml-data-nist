    <abstract>This paper quantifies the pool boiling performance of R515A, R1234ze(E), and R1233zd(E) on a flattened, horizontal Turbo-ESP surface for air-conditioning applications for heat fluxes between roughly 10 kWm-2 and 100 kWm-2. Both R515A and R1234ze(E) are replacements for R134a, while R1233zd(E) is a replacement for R123. The measured boiling curve for R515A had roughly a 14 [percent] larger heat flux than that of R1234ze(E) for heat fluxes greater than 45 kWm-2. For heat fluxes between 14 kWm-2 and 85 kWm-2, R515A and R1234ze(E) exhibited a heat flux that was 33 [percent] and 17 [percent] larger than that for R134a. The heat flux of R1233zd(E) was roughly 18 [percent] larger than that for R123 for heat fluxes between 30 kWm-2 and 87 kWm-2. A pool boiling model that was previously developed for pure and mixed refrigerants on the Turbo-ESP surface was improved by nondimensionalizing the model constants and improving their statistical significance. For most heat fluxes, the model predicted the measured superheat to within +/- 0.7 K. The model was used to show that the vapor Prandtl number and the product of the latent heat and vapor density significantly influenced the boiling heat flux.</abstract>
