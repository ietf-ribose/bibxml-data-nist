    <abstract>Thirteen different flush mounted pressure transducers of seven different manufacturers were tested by applying a thermal gradient to them and recording their resultant zero shifts. Photographs of typical outputs are shown and the results are compared. Some suggestions for possible improvements are given.</abstract>
