    <abstract>These 85 citations to the literature of benchmarking and workload definition were selected from a longer list of documents, encompassing a somewhat broader scope, that was submitted to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Task Group 13 in response to a request made to attendees of the Task Group's Planning Session held on July 12, 1973, at the National Bureau of Standards. The bibliographic effort was to be directed not so much toward exhaustiveness as toward the development of a bibliography that the attendees had found useful and would, therefore, recommend to other workers in the field. Of the approximately 250 citations submitter to the Task Group, these 85 were selected on the basis of two criteria: (1) the item dealt primarily with benchmarking or workload definition; and (2) hard copy was available at the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology.</abstract>
