    <abstract>The purpose of this executive summary is to provide key stakeholders with relevant information about how PSCR spent Public Safety Trust Funds and the impacts of that funding. Furthermore, this report seeks to demonstrate the value and positive outcomes of a one-time injection of funds into a topic area and the extent to which this model can be repeated in other areas of significant impact, such as semiconductor supply or climate change. PSCR extensively tracked its impacts since 2016, aligning them across five leading indicators: research capacity, disruptive approaches and technology, standards, products, and public safety methods. Furthermore, data from extramural award recipients, prize challenge competitors, and accelerator program participants have been included to provide a more holistic view of programmatic impact. However, only preliminary data is included in this executive summary and a more complete and comprehensive report with additional analysis is scheduled to be published in spring 2023.</abstract>
