    <abstract>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a collection of latent fingerprint images as part of Special Database (SD) 302 in December 2019. While the dataset included 10 000 never-before-seen operational quality images from 200 study participants, SD 302 has been of somewhat limited usability, in part due to the omission of study participant finger position ground truth. To help make SD 302 as robust and useful to the community as possible, NIST has funded certified latent print examiners to annotate and determine the source of the latent fingerprint images distributed as part of SD 302.</abstract>
