    <abstract>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, hosted a Workshop on Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostic, and Prognostic Technologies at the conclusion of the ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) on June 8th and 9th, 2017, on the campus of University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together key subject matter experts to identify manufacturing needs and wants with respect to advanced monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies (collectively known as prognostics and health management (PHM)), along with ways of verifying and validating their performance to enhance maintenance and control strategies within manufacturing operations at the factory?floor. This report documents this two-day event which summarizes presentations and brainstorming sessions in addition to detailing the key topic area discussions. The findings in this document are expected to provide a foundation for which a future ASME standards effort will be built. Likewise, the next steps in this effort are detailed towards the end of this document including two follow-up events that will further articulate key topic areas of focus.</abstract>
