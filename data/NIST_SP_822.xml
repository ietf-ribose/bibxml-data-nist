    <abstract>The report includes proceedings of a workshop sponsored jointly by NIST and the Schools of Technology and Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia, and held in Gaithersburg, Maryland, November 13-15, 1990. The workshop theme was strengthening materials education. Material in the publication can serve as a valuable guide to faculty who are interested in useful experiments for their students. There was a blend of experiments on new materials and traditional materials. Uses of computers in MS, experuimental design and an approach to A ystematic materials are among the topics presented.</abstract>
