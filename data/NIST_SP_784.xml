    <abstract>At the request of the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Technology Development the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Robot Systems Division organized and hosted the first DOE/NIST Workshop on Common Architectures for Robotic Systems. The workshop had three goals: An initial review of the methodologies currently used by the DOE sites for development and maintenance of software related to robotic and remote systems; presentations by representatives of other government agencies on lessons learned in the development of common architectures for robotic and remote systems; and a preliminary assessment of the methodology necessary to arrive at a DOE common architecture.</abstract>
