    <abstract>This report highlights the GCTC/SC3 Expo event held on July 11-12, 2019 to foster discussion of and collaboration to address the cybersecurity and privacy challenges faced by cities as they implement smart technologies. Over 1000 representatives from cities, industry, government, private institutions and academia with an interest in smart cities attended the event. The event included a series of plenary and panel sessions, interactive technical breakout sessions and open forums related to the GCTC domains. The February 2018 GCTC/SC3 Kickoff in Washington DC and June 2018 Global Tech Jam in Portland, Oregon, USA, contributed to the success of this event.</abstract>
