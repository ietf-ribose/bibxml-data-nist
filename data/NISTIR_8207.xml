    <abstract>Iris Exchange (IREX) IX is an evaluation of automated iris recognition algorithms. The first part of the evaluation is a performance test of both verification (one-to-one) and identification (one-to-many) recognition algorithms over operational test data. The results are summarized in this report. Thirteen developers submitted recognition algorithms for testing, more than any previous IREX evaluation. Performance was measured for 46 matching algorithms over a set of approximately 700K field-collected iris images. This report is very similar to IREX IV: Part 1, Evaluation of Iris Identification Algorithms in both format and scope.</abstract>
