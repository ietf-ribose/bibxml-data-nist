    <abstract>This publication describes the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NWF), the product of many years of collaboration regarding workforce training and education. The NWF, as a working document, provides a fundamental reference resource for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work roles andthe knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete tasks in those work roles. As a common, consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work, the NWF improves communication about how to identify, recruit, develop, and retain cybersecurity talent. The NWF is a reference source from which organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools focused on defining or providing guidance on aspects of workforce development, planning, training, and education.</abstract>
