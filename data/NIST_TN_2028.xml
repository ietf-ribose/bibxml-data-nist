    <abstract>The FireCARES (Community Assessment Response Evaluation System) project is a web-based tool intended to help fire departments effectively match resources to community risk. Among other things, the analysis includes estimates of the community risk and estimates of effectiveness of response. This report documents the estimation of the community risk for fires, fire injuries, fire deaths, and emergency medical services calls. The community risk for fires is broken out by low- medium- and high-hazard properties as defined in NFPA Standard 1710.</abstract>
