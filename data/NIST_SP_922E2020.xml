    <abstract>NIST Special Publication (SP) 922 is an aid in the identification of the chemical structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The Structure Index consists of two parts: (1) a cross index of named PAHs listed in alphabetical order and (2) chemical structures including ring numbering, name(s), Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry numbers, chemical formulas, molecular weights, and length-to-breadth ratios (L/B) and shape descriptors of PAHs listed in order of increasing molecular weight.</abstract>
