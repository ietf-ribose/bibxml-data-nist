    <abstract>The purpose of the Historic Structure Report is to examine the architectural history of these significant federal buildings, inventory character defining features, and establish Preservation Zones to inform future maintenance and renovations. This report incorporates the information and research specific to the architecture of General Purpose Laboratories on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This report addresses all exterior and interior spaces and features (excluding structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing building systems) of the following General Purpose Laboratories: Buildings 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, and 226. The Historic Structure Report is intended to be used as a reference document for the NIST, the Office of Facilities and Property Management (OFPM) and its staff as well as for outside contractors of the existing conditions and their relative significance for consideration when planning, designing and completing work on General Purpose Laboratories. While every effort has been made to document and evaluate significant architectural and construction features, it is not intended to limit future changes required by ever-evolving mission of scientific research that defines the agency.</abstract>
