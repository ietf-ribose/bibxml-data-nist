    <abstract>This proceedings documents the July 11-12, 2017 Enhancing Resilience of the Internet and Communications Ecosystem workshop led by National Institute of Standards and Technology Standards. Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure required the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security to jointly lead an open and transparent process to identify and promote action by appropriate stakeholders to improve the resilience of the internet and communications ecosystem and to encourage collaboration with the goal of dramatically reducing threats perpetrated by automated and distributed attacks (e.g., botnets). The workshop was designed to allow stakeholders to explore a range of current and emerging solutions to enhance the resilience of the Internet and communications ecosystem (the ecosystem) against automated, distributed threats in an open and transparent manner. The workshop attracted 150 participants from diverse stakeholder communities and was conducted under Chatham House Rules.</abstract>
