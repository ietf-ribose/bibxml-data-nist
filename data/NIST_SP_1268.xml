    <abstract>NIST held a three-day workshop, Challenges for Digital Proximity Detection in Pandemics: Privacy, Accuracy, and Impact Jan. 26th 28th, 2021. Members of industry, academia, nonprofits, state, and federal government were brought together to discuss successes and challenges associated with implementation of proximity detection technologies and to identify areas in which additional effort is required. The first day featured invited speakers on a variety of aspects of proximity detection and the existing challenges. The second day featured a panel discussion and facilitated break-out sessions to provide opportunity for community engagement on ways to overcome the challenges presented in the first day. The final day included reports from the break-out sessions, contributed technical talks, and a wrap-up discussion. This document provides an overview of the presentations and discussions and describes key themes that emerged during the workshop. The agenda, video of the invited talks on Jan. 26th and of the panel discussion on Jan. 27th, and slides from the contributed talks are available on the website, https://www.nist.gov/newsevents/events/2021/01/challenges-digital-proximity-detection-pandemics-privacy-accuracyand.</abstract>
