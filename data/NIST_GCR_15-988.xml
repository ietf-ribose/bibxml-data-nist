    <abstract>Industrial users of ISO 10303 (STEP) protocols need the ability to exchange design product data that is in conformance with recently updated ISO Geometric Product Specifications (GPS) ISO 1101:2012; with AWS A2.4:2012 Standard Symbols for Welding, Brazing, and Nondestructive Examination; with ISO 2553: 2013 Welding and allied processes -- Symbolic representation on drawings -- Welded joints; with SAE AS8879D and ISO 3161:1999 Aerospace -- UNJ threads -- General requirements and limit dimensions; with and ISO 5855-1:1999 -- Aerospace -- MJ threads -- Part 1: General requirements. The LOTAR consortium created a project to extend ISO 10303-242 for these new capabilities. Changes to relevant STEP information models have been proposed to support the additions to ISO 1101, and new information models proposed to support the welding and thread standards.</abstract>
