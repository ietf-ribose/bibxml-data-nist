    <abstract>A novel wireless sensor network is developed and demonstrated for monitoring indoor fixturelevel water use in buildings. The new technology consists of a low-cost, battery-powered,miniature wireless sensor module for non-invasive detection of flow through pipes. Whendeployed in a typical commercial, industrial, or residential building, the modules form a remotewireless sensor network that accurately monitors the incidence and patterns of water usage atindividual fixtures. As proof of concept, the wireless sensor network was deployed and tested ina dormitory at the University of Cincinnati (UC) where several water fixtures were monitored ata 1-second interval for a period of five months. The water use data were analyzed to obtainpeak period probabilities of fixture use (i.e., p-values). Fixture p-values are needed to estimatethe instantaneous peak water demand in buildings, the key parameter for properly sizingpremise plumbing systems. A dimensionless ramp function on the unit square is developed anddemonstrated as a versatile approach to help engineers obtain reasonable estimates of fixturep-values in new buildings where water use data may be lacking or sparse. A protocol issuggested to guide investigators on how to compile, consolidate, and archive high resolutionwater use data into a cloud-based repository. Results include preliminary estimates of p-valuesfor restroom fixtures in a large sports arena on the UC campus. Peak flows at the sport arenameasured during five NCAA basketball game days are compared against predicted peak flowsfrom the Water Demand Calculator. Finally, peak flow measurements at 20 large contemporaryresidential buildings across the US are compared against predictions of the 99th percentile fromthe Water Demand Calculator.</abstract>
