    <abstract>In this study, we elongated glass-fiber model composites in tension to monitor local fiber breakage in the epoxy matrix under quasi-static loading (approximately 0.00001 s-1) and high rate loading (approximately 200 s-1). Strains for the initial fiber breaks were around 2 % under the quasi-static loading, while the strains for the initial fiber breaks were around 4 % to 5 % for the high strain rate loading, indicating significant rate dependent characteristics on tensile failure strains of the glass fibers.</abstract>
