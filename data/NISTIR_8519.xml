    <abstract>NIST launched a Cannabis Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (CannaQAP) in 2020 to assist laboratories in demonstrating and improving cannabis (hemp and marijuana) measurement comparability and competence. CannaQAP provides tools that allow analysts and laboratories to assess how their methods perform relative to the community and to an accepted value. Exercise 2 of CannaQAP focused on the determination of cannabinoids (Î”9 -THC, THCA, total THC, CBD, CBDA, total CBD, and up to 13 additional cannabinoids), moisture, and toxic elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, U, Mn, Be, V, and Hg) in cannabis plant material.</abstract>
