    <abstract>Achieving the vision of 'smart manufacturing' and 'Industrie 4.0' requires building on successes in computational control of processes to create generic approaches for management of manufacturing operations, or smart manufacturing operations management (SMOM). The approach to SMOM presented in this report generalizes the modeling framework of ISA-95 with a reference model for discrete event logistics systems (DELS) that identifes fve generic operations management decisions. This report applies it in a computational model of a large-scale, highly-automated central fll pharmacy that is the basis for a simulation testbed enabling convenient experimentation with operations management policies and decision algorithms.</abstract>
