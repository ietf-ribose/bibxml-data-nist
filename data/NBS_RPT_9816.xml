    <abstract>An extensometer for use as a laboratory standard at temperatures up to 3000 ¿̐¿F (1650 ¿̐¿C) was designed. This extensometer was to operate in normal atmosphere under static and transient mechanical and thermal conditions, including intense thermal radiation. A prototype system, extensometer and indicating unit, was constructed. Static tests at temperatures up to 1500 ¿̐¿F (815 ¿̐¿C) and dynamic tests to temperatures above 2500 ¿̐¿F (1390 ¿̐¿C) were conducted. The results of these tests show that the system has a range of at least 0.085 inch (2.2 mm), has a resolution of 10^-5 inch, is linear to within about 0.1 percent of range, and has a random error of about 2 x 10^-5 inch. The results indicate that the extensometer could probably be used at temperatures approaching 3000 ¿̐¿F (1650 ¿̐¿C) although it was not tested under these conditions. The design of the extensometer and indicator, materials used, description of components, methods of fabrication and assembly, and testing procedures are given.</abstract>
