    <abstract>Due to the significant life-safety and economic loss resulting from extreme, low probability, high consequence weather events such as Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, and the Joplin tornado, greater focus has been placed on increasing the resiliency of buildings to decrease these impacts. Investigations of building performance following tornadoes and hurricanes have shown that wind-borne debris, including loose aggregate, gravel, and stone surfacing on roofs are significant contributors to building damage and occupant injuries. Buildings may often experience little to no structural damage, but suffer failure of exterior glazing, causing catastrophic damage to building interiors and building contents that can also result in injuries and fatalities. A recent proposed code change to the International Building Code (IBC) would prohibit installation of loose aggregate surfacing on roofs of Risk Category III or IV buildings located in the most tornado-prone region of the country (covering portions of the Great Plains, Midwest, and Deep South) in order to reduce the wind-borne debris hazard, particularly to glazed openings. Existing building codes already have provisions prohibiting the use of roof aggregate to reduce wind-borne debris hazards in hurricane-prone regions (IBC 2015, Section 1504.8), and expansion of similar provisions in the tornado-prone region are those currently being considered. However, the economic impacts of these proposed code changes to prohibit the use of roof aggregate in tornado-prone regions are not currently well understood. Needed is an assessment of the impacted building stock and the magnitude of associated costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential economic impacts from adoption of this proposed change to the IBC by identifying the fraction of roof construction that could be impacted from the restriction on aggregate surfaced roofs, characterizing alternatives to aggregate-surfaced roofing systems, and estimating the costs associated with these alternative roofing systems. The results are presented using both a national and regional perspective, including a comparison of the impacts from the restrictions on aggregate in the hurricane-prone regions. The results demonstrate that the code change would potentially impact less than 0.1 % of all roof construction in the U.S., and less than 3.0 % of all non-low rise residential roof construction in the tornado-prone region. This includes roofs of newly constructed buildings and reroofing projects. The previously adopted code change that similarly prohibited aggregate-surfaced roofs in the hurricane-prone region impacted more than four times as much roof construction. It is found that few roof construction projects will be negatively impacted from a construction cost perspective by the proposed restriction on aggregate in the tornado-prone region (0.2 %) because cost-effective alternatives are available for most assemblies. Common types of aggregate-surfaced roofing that would be prohibited under the proposed code change can be more expensive than similar alternatives. For example, built-up roofs with aggregate surfacing are found to cost more than the alternative system that replaces the aggregate with a cap sheet. For single-ply roof systems over a steel roof deck, aggregate ballasted EPDM is also found to be more expensive than mechanically attached EPDM. Only in the case of the single-ply systems over a concrete roof deck are aggregate ballasted EPDM systems found to be less expensive than the alternative EPDM systems. These results hold for all 33 cities studied within the tornado-prone region.</abstract>
