    <abstract>This report documents the measurement of the wind resistance of different types of vegetation. The measurements are made in a wind tunnel with a 2.0 m test section and 0.5 m by 0.5 m cross- section. Samples of vegetation have been cut into cubical volumes that span the cross-section of the tunnel. The wind resistance is inferred via measurement of the pressure drop across the sample at wind speeds ranging from 2 m/s to 8 m/s. The results are compared to empirical correlations quantifying the wind resistance of regularly spaced vertical tubes of comparable geometric characteristics.</abstract>
