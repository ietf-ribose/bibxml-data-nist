    <abstract>In September 2014, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) commenced a task order project under National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Contract SB1341-13-CQ-0009 to conduct comprehensive review of the generalized component models published in the current ASCE/SEI standard and relevant research, and develop recommendations for improvement (ATC-114 Project). The need for defining parameters for nonlinear force-deformation models for components, elements, or assemblies is identified as a high-priority research and development topic in NIST GCR 14-917-27 report, Nonlinear Analysis Study and Development Program for Performance-Based Seismic Engineering, (NIST, 2013) which outlines a research and development program for addressing the gap between state-of-the-art academic research and state-of-practice engineering applications for nonlinear structural analysis, analytical structural modeling, and computer simulation in support of performance-based seismic engineering. The current standard, ASCE/SEI 41-13, Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing Buildings (ASCE, 2014), is widely used by designers for evaluating and upgrading existing buildings. The component models in the current standard were developed for use in existing building analysis, but they have also become widely employed in new building analysis. The purpose of this report is to recommend broad improvements to seismic nonlinear modeling and acceptance criteria requirements for different structural systems.</abstract>
