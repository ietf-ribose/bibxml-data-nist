    <abstract>This report identifies and describes several of the most significant gaps within various components of the wireless industry. This report is intended to serve solely as a knowledge product that recognizes the major challenges facing the broader research community, and does not prescribe to make R recommendations in light of specific organizations, initiatives, or standards development efforts. The data presented in this report was gathered through market research, a series of stakeholder interviews, and public working group meetings.</abstract>
