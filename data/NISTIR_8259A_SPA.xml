    <abstract>Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions that computing devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software). This publication defines an Internet of Things (IoT) device cybersecurity capability core baseline, which is a set of device capabilities generally needed to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organization s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems. The purpose of this publication is to provide organizations a starting point to use in identifying the device cybersecurity capabilities for new IoT devices they will manufacture, integrate, or acquire. This publication can be used in conjunction with NISTIR 8259, Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers.</abstract>
