    <abstract>Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2917 is intended for calibrating qPCR-based assays of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for assessing water quality. A unit of SRM 2917 consists of 6?Levels of linearized plasmid DNA. The length of DNA is approximately 4.4 kb; it contains 13 single-copy PCR target regions. The 6 Levels span a log10 dilution series from approximately (5 to 500,000) plasmid copy per uL. Each Level is suspended in 1 TE buffer at pH 8 with approximately 10 ng/uL yeast tRNA. Approximately 0.2 mL of each Level were bottled in 1.5 mL skirted centrifuge vials. In total, approximately 1000 units were generated. The material is both stable and should be stored at 4? C. The production, analytical methods, statistical evaluation, and certified values of this SRM are described herein.</abstract>
